## Introduction 

This tutorial is an introduction to data preparation using the data.table package for importing, exploring, and structuring data. Our goal is to transform, reshape, and join data frames to obtain the form we need for analysis and graphs. 

[Prerequisites] should be completed before proceeding. After that, the tutorial should take about an hour. 

- As you work through the tutorial, type a line or chunk of code then *File &gt; Save* and run the script.    
- Confirm that your result matches the tutorial result.  
- The **exercises** give you chance to practice your new skills to learn by doing (but you knew that already)!


## Start a new script

Create a new script for this tutorial. 

- See [Create a script] if you need a refresher on creating, saving, and running an R script. 
- At the top of the script add a minimal header and install and load the packages indicated.  

```{r}
# Data basics 
# Name 
# Date 

# Packages used in this tutorial
library("midfieldr")
library("midfielddata")
library("data.table")
library("VIM")

# Optional code to control data.table printing
options(
  datatable.print.nrows = 10,
  datatable.print.topn = 5,
  datatable.print.class = TRUE
)

# Load midfielddata data sets to use later
data(student)
data(term) 
data(degree) 
```

If you get an error like this one after running the script, 

        Error in library("VIM") : there is no package called 'VIM'

then the package needs to be installed. If you need a refresher on installing packages, see [Install CRAN packages]. Once the missing package is installed, you can rerun the script. 




##  Data sets in R 

Practice data sets are included with the basic R installation and with some R packages. To list the practice data sets available in R, type in the Console,

```r
# Type in the Console 
data() 
```

which yields

     #> Data sets in package ‘datasets’:
     #>    
     #> AirPassengers  Monthly Airline Passenger Numbers
     #> BJsales        Sales Data with Leading Indicator
     #> BOD            Biochemical Oxygen Demand
     #> CO2            Carbon Dioxide Uptake in Grass Plants
     #> Formaldehyde   Determination of Formaldehyde
     etc.

We use the `data()` function to list practice datasets included in a package (if any). For example, to determine what packages are bundled with the midfieldr package, type in the Console, 

```r
# Type in the Console 
data(package = "midfieldr") 
```

which yields

     #> Data sets in package ‘midfieldr’:
     #>   
     #> cip                   Table of academic programs
     #> fye_start             Starting programs imputed for FYE students
     #> study_grad_rate       Case-study graduation rate results
     #> study_program         Case-study programs
     #> study_stickiness      Case-study stickiness results
     #> study_student         Case-study students
     #> toy_course            Course data for examples
     #> toy_degree            Degree data for examples
     #> toy_student           Student data for examples
     #> toy_term              Term data for examples



Every data set in base R and in R packages has a help page that describes the data format and variable names. The data help page can be accessed using `help()`, for example, 

```r
# Type in the Console 
help(cip, package = "midfieldr")
```

Alternatively, if the package is loaded, you may run the `? item-name` syntax in the Console,  

```r
# type in the Console
library("midfieldr")
? cip
```

yields

```{r echo = FALSE}
htmltools::img(src = knitr::include_graphics("figures/data-basics-cip-help.png"),
               alt   = 'starwars help page',
               style = 'left:0px; padding:0px;',
               width = 600)
```

The midfieldr  "toy" data sets are small subsets by row and column of the MIDFIELD tables that we use later in the vignette examples. You can view their help pages by running, e.g., `? toy_student`, or by clicking the links to the same information online. 

- [`toy_student`](https://midfieldr.github.io/midfieldr/reference/toy_student.html)
- [`toy_course`](https://midfieldr.github.io/midfieldr/reference/toy_course.html)

##  Data structure 

When we encounter a data set, the first step is to characterize its structure including, 

class
: The class of the R data object, for example, vector, matrix, data frame, time series, list, etc. The R  data frame is the structure we use most often, typically in the enhanced [`data.table`](https://rdatatable.gitlab.io/data.table/) form. For data frames, we are also interested in the class of each column. 

layout
: How tables, rows, and columns are organized and keyed with  unique and invariant coordinates to data cells. Most data processing steps have a preferred format, so we have to be able to identify and transform layouts as needed. 

The most common data layout we use is the *denormalized* form (what many R users recognize as the "tidy" form) with variables in columns, observations in rows, and a clear taxonomy of column roles: some columns are *keys* (i.e., coordinates that uniquely identify the row), one or more columns are *data* (called "payload" in SQL), and some columns may be *derived* (functions of  other columns). 

For example, if we examine the first 5 rows of the `term` data (ordered by ID and term), 

```{r}
term[order(mcid, term)][1:5]
```

- Keys are `mcid` and `term`.  
- Column `institution` is derived (assuming the student is affiliated with one institution only) because it is a function of student ID. 
- The remaining variables are data. 
- Column `gpa_cumul` is class *numeric* (double-precision); all other columns are class *character* (strings). 

Applying a similar procedure to the aggregated `study_stickiness` data set loaded with midfieldr, 

```{r}
study_stickiness
```

- Keys are `program`, `race`, and `sex`. 
- Number enrolled (`ever`) and number graduating (`grad`) are data. 
- Program stickiness (`stick`) is derived (the ratio of `grad` to `ever`). 
- The key columns are class *character*; `ever` and `grad` are class *integer*; and `stick` is class *numeric* (double-precision). 


### Exercises

The following midfieldr/midfielddata data frames are all in denormalized form. For each, identify their key(s), data, and derived (if any) columns.  

1. `cip`  
1. `study_student`  
1. `student`  
1. `course`  
1. `degree `  






## What is a data.table?

In our tutorials and in our package functions, we manipulate data using the data.table package, primarily for its speed with large tables but also for its concise syntax and its zero dependencies. Thus, when you use a midfieldr function to operate on a data frame, the returned data frame is also a data.table object. 

For R beginners, we try to keep our use of data.table in tutorials to an introductory level, though we will occasionally use a more complex syntax when the benefit is worth the cognitive load. 

What is a data.table? The [data.table cheat sheet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/master/pngs/datatable.png) defines data.table this way:

> data.table is an extremely fast and memory efficient package for    
> transforming data in R. The basics of working with data.tables are:    
>    
>         DT[i,  j,  by]    
  
Here `i` can subset or reorder rows, `j` is used to select, summarize, compute with, or create or delete columns, and `by` is the grouping operator. 


A `data.table` is also a `data.frame`---functions that work with a `data.frame` therefore also work with a `data.table`. 








## Subset rows

Summary: In a data.table `DT[i, j, by]`, using `i` to keep or drop rows. 

Typically we create a Boolean statement to subset rows. A row is retained if the statement yields TRUE for that row and dropped in the statement yields FALSE.  Thus the basic idea for row subsetting is to create a vector of TRUE and FALSE values the same length as there are rows in the data frame. 




### Logical operators 

The commonly used Boolean operators are equal to (`==`),  not equal to (`!=`), and (`&`), or (`|`), less than (`<`), greater than (`>`), less than or equal to (`<=`), and greater than or equal to (`>=`).

For example, if we wanted to subset `toy_course` for all rows for a particular student, we write (in data.table fashion)

```{r}
# Subset course data for one student by their ID
DT <- toy_course[mcid == "MID25783939"]

# Examine the result
DT
```

We often construct the Boolean statement on its own line. To illustrate, the following lines produce equivalent results, 

```r
# The subsetting line we used above
DT <- toy_course[mcid == "MID25783939"]

# Equivalent form
rows_we_want <- term$mcid == "MID25783939"
DT <- toy_course[rows_we_want]
```

Note that in the second case we must use the `df$col` syntax, where `df` is the name of the data.frame and `col` is the name of the column in the data frame. This approach  can be useful when the logical statement has multiple clauses, e.g., subset rows with CIP code 140102 at Institution M, 

```{r}
# Create a TRUE/FALSE vector with as many entries as term has rows 
rows_we_want <- toy_term$cip6 == "140102" & 
  toy_term$institution == "Institution M"

# Examine the result
str(rows_we_want)

# Confirm the TRUE/FALSE vector has as many entries as term has rows 
nrow(toy_term)
```

A row is retained if the logical statement yields TRUE for that row and dropped in the statement yields FALSE.

```{r}
# Retain rows for which rows_we_want is TRUE
DT <- toy_term[rows_we_want]

# examine the result
DT
```

Logical expressions can have multiple clauses, for example, suppose we want all degree data for Institution A from 2000 through 2002.  

```{r}
rows_we_want <- degree$institution == "Institution A" & 
  degree$term >= "20001" &
  degree$term <= "20026"
degree[rows_we_want]
```







### Character matching 

We regularly use the data.table functions `%ilike%` and `%chin%` to create logical expressions for subsetting rows. 


`%ilike%` is a convenience function for calling `grep()`, the base R function for character pattern matching. The `i` in `%ilike%`  is the version that ignores case. View its help page by running, 
 
``` r
? `%ilike%`
```

For example, we often subset `student` data to omit populations with ambiguous race/ethnicity values such as International and Other/Unknown, as follows.

```{r}
DT <- toy_student

# Examine the unique values of race/ethnicity
sort(unique(DT$race))
```

To identify the rows with "Other/Unknown" or "International", we construct a logical statement in which the search terms are in a single quoted character string separated by the logical OR `|` operator.  Because `%ilike%` is based on `grep()`, partial matching is OK, so we don't have to spell out the full strings. 

```{r}
# Logical vector that returns TRUE for the two values
rows_we_omit <- DT$race %ilike% "Other|Internat"

# Examine the logical vector 
rows_we_omit

# Return the rows for Other and International 
DT[rows_we_omit]
```

We see that in the toy student data, we have five students recorded as International or Other/Unknown. However, we want to omit these students from the data. To get the rows we want, we simply negate the `rows_we_omit` logical vector using the `!` operator. 

```{r}
# TRUE becomes FALSE; FALSE becomes TRUE
rows_we_want <- !rows_we_omit

# Examine the new logical vector 
rows_we_want

# Equivalently
rows_we_want <- !DT$race %ilike% "Other|Internat"

# Return the rows we want
DT[rows_we_want]
```

Of course, the logical statement for row subsetting can be placed within the brackets, and we replace the  `DT$race` form with the column name `race` alone, yielding the same result. 

``` r
# Equivalent statement inside the []
DT[!race %ilike% "Other|Internat"]
```

Another character matching function we use regularly for subsetting rows is the data.table function `%chin%`, a fast versions of `match()`, `%in%` and `order()`, optimized for character vectors. `%chin%` operates on two character vectors, returning a vector of the positions of (first) matches of its first argument in its second.  View its help page by running, 
 
``` r
? `%chin%`
```

To illustrate `%chin%` usage, we do the same subset by row that we did above with `%ilike%`. The first character vector is the `race` column in `DT`. The second vector is the vector of terms we are matching to, "International and "Other/Unknown",  that must be written in full (no partial matching) and are in a character vector (elements separated by commas). 

```{r}
DT <- toy_student

# Subset rows using %chin% 
rows_we_omit <- DT$race %chin% c("International", "Other/Unknown")

# use the T/F vector to subset the data frame by row
DT[!rows_we_omit]
```

Of course, the logical operation can be inside the `[]` as well. 

``` r 
# Equivalent statement inside the []
DT[!race %chin% c("International", "Other/Unknown")]
```

In addition, it is sometimes useful to have the second vector named on its own, e.g., 

``` r
# Another equivalent statement
values_to_drop <- c("International", "Other/Unknown")
DT[!race %chin% values_to_drop]
```








## Select columns 

Summary: In a data.table `DT[i, j, by]`, using `j` to keep, drop or reorder columns. 

```{r}
# Print out the names of the columns
names(toy_student)

# Select columns to keep
toy_student[, list(mcid, race, sex)]

# Equivalent
toy_student[, .(mcid, race, sex)]
```

When used for a data.table column operation, the notation `.()` is a shorthand substitute for `list()`. A third option that we use regularly is placing the quoted column names in a character vector, e.g., 

```{r}
cols_we_want <- c("mcid", "race", "sex") 
```

and using the "double-dot" notation shown below (`..cols_we_want`) to subset the columns, 

```{r}
toy_student[, ..cols_we_want]
```

this last approach is particularly useful when we have a set of columns used several times for subsetting, grouping, and joining. 




```{r echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
# We only need two columns for the plot
cols_we_want <- c("sat_math", "sat_verbal")
sat <- student[, ..cols_we_want]
```








## Operate on columns 

- delete
- create 
- apply function 



```{r echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
# DT <- copy(student)[, .(race, sex)]
# DT[, race_sex := paste(race, sex)]
# DT[, c("race", "sex") := NULL]
# 
# 
# DT[, race_sex := factor(race_sex)]
# DT[, race_sex := reorder(race_sex, N)]
```






## Grouping 

- by 
- .SD



```{r echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
# DT <- DT[, .N, by = "race_sex"]
```









## Other row operations 


### Unique rows

Both the `term` and `course` data  tables have multiple rows for the same student. When subsetting data like these and we want to eliminate duplicate rows, we use `unique()`. 



 
- `na.omit()`
- order
- unique()









## Reference semantics










## Reshaping


```{r echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
# # Create student_demogr.rds and append to prepared_data.zip
# DT <- copy(student)[, .(race, sex)]
# DT[, race_sex := paste(race, sex)]
# DT[, c("race", "sex") := NULL]
# DT <- DT[, .N, by = "race_sex"]
# DT <- DT[!race_sex %ilike% "Other|International"]
# DT[, race_sex := factor(race_sex)]
# DT[, race_sex := reorder(race_sex, N)]
# 
# 
# 
# # Create student_demogr.rds and append to prepared_data.zip
# DT <- add_race_sex(term, midfield_student = student)
# cols_we_want <- c("mcid", "term", "hours_term", "level", "sex")
# DT <- DT[, ..cols_we_want]
# DT <- unique(DT)
# 
# DT <- copy(study_stickiness)
# DT[, race_sex := paste(race, sex)]
# DT[, race_sex := factor(race_sex)]
# DT[, program  := factor(program)]
```
