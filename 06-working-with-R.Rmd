R is an open source language and environment for statistical computing and graphics [@R-base], ranked by IEEE in 2020 as the 6th most popular programming language (Python, Java, and C are the top three) [@Cass:2020]. If you are new to R, some of its best features, paraphrasing Wickham  [-@wickham2014advanced], are: 

- R is free, open source, and available on every major platform. 
- R packages provide effective tools for data analysis and visualization. 
- More than `r n_pkg` open-source R packages are available (`r date_pkg`). Many are cutting-edge tools. 

RStudio, an integrated development environment (IDE) for R, includes a console, editor, and tools for plotting, history, debugging, and workspace management as well as access to GitHub for collaboration and version control  [@2016rstudio]. 




## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, you should have completed

- [Install everything]    
- Launched your workshop project---`workshop.Rproj` or other name that you selected---to start the R session     

With these prerequisites accomplished, and working in your RStudio  `workshop.Rproj` project, you can create a save a script by:

- Use the pulldown menu, _File &gt; New File &gt; R Script_ 
- File menu > Save As... 
- In the dialog box, navigate to your `scripts` directory, type a file name, for example, `01-R-basics.R` (file names in R can start with numerals), and _Save_. 

We suggest you start a new R script for each tutorial and save it to the `scripts` directory. For example, at the end of the workshop, your scripts directory might contain the following files:     

``` r
        \scripts    
            \01-R-basics.R    
            \02-getting-started.R    
            \03-case-study-programs.R    
            \04-case-study-students.R     
            etc.  
```



## New to R? 

[Prerequisites] should be completed before proceeding. By the end of the workshop, our R beginners will have made progress on two or possibly three tutorials:  

- [R basics] An introduction to R. 
- [Getting started](https://midfieldr.github.io/midfieldr/articles/art-000-getting-started.html){target="_blank"}: Examine the MIDFIELD practice data  
- [Case study programs](https://midfieldr.github.io/midfieldr/articles/art-110-case-study-programs.html){target="_blank"} Gather CIP codes and program names

If there is still time remaining, continue to any tutorial listed in the [After the workshop] section.  













## Familiar with R? 

[Prerequisites] should be completed before proceeding. By the end of the workshop, our more experienced R users will have made substantive progress on two or possibly three tutorials: 

- [Getting started](https://midfieldr.github.io/midfieldr/articles/art-000-getting-started.html){target="_blank"}: Examine the MIDFIELD practice data  
- [Case study programs](https://midfieldr.github.io/midfieldr/articles/art-110-case-study-programs.html){target="_blank"} Gather CIP codes and program names 
- [Case study students](https://midfieldr.github.io/midfieldr/articles/art-120-case-study-students.html){target="_blank"} Gather students who pass the data sufficiency criterion. 



If there is still time remaining, continue to any tutorial listed in the [After the workshop] section.  
 
 
 
 
## After the workshop 

At his point, the learning is self-directed. Choose the skills you want to continue working on. We have a set of tutorials for 

- [Developing R skills] 
- [Continuing the case study]
- [Exploring midfieldr functions]





### Developing R skills

The basic skills tutorials take about 50 minutes each. 

- [R basics] 
- [Graph basics]  
- [Data basics]   





### Continuing the case study

The case study is a quick tour of a typical workflow using student unit record data. This is a “big picture” development---functions are used without detailed explanations or development so that we can focus on the logic of the analysis. For exploring midfieldr functions and methods in greater detail, see the vignettes listed in the next section.  

- [Case study programs](https://midfieldr.github.io/midfieldr/articles/art-110-case-study-programs.html){target="_blank"}
- [Case study students](https://midfieldr.github.io/midfieldr/articles/art-120-case-study-students.html){target="_blank"} 
- [Case study stickiness](https://midfieldr.github.io/midfieldr/articles/art-130-case-study-stickiness.html){target="_blank"} 
- [Case study graduation rate](https://midfieldr.github.io/midfieldr/articles/art-140-case-study-grad-rate.html){target="_blank"}





### Exploring midfieldr functions

Deep dive into the midfieldr functionality. The work flow follows the same general pattern as the quicker case study, but pauses to explore each function in more detail, exploring the arguments and strategies for use. In general, each tutorial is self-contained so you may enter at almost any point. 

- [Program codes and names](https://midfieldr.github.io/midfieldr/articles/art-010-program-codes.html){target="_blank"} Practice strategies of searching `cip` for programs we want to study. 
- [Subsetting MIDFIELD data](https://midfieldr.github.io/midfieldr/articles/art-015-subsetting-midfield-data.html){target="_blank"} Use programs codes to subset the MIDFIELD data tables. 
- [Data sufficiency](https://midfieldr.github.io/midfieldr/articles/art-020-data-sufficiency.html){target="_blank"} What it is and how it is applied to student unit-record (SUR) data. 
- [Timely completion](https://midfieldr.github.io/midfieldr/articles/art-030-timely-completion.html){target="_blank"} What it is and how it is applied to SUR data. 
- [FYE programs](https://midfieldr.github.io/midfieldr/articles/art-040-fye-programs.html){target="_blank"} What they are and how they are accommodated with SUR data. 
- [Multiway graphs](https://midfieldr.github.io/midfieldr/articles/art-050-multiway-graphs.html){target="_blank"} How to graph and interpret a common data structure encountered when working with SUR data. 
- [Tabulating data](https://midfieldr.github.io/midfieldr/articles/art-060-tabulating-data.html){target="_blank"} How to tabulate multiway data for publication. 



## R basics

This tutorial is an introduction to R adapted from [@Healy:2019:Ch.2] with extra material from [@Matloff:2019]. If you already have R experience, you might still want to browse this section in case you find something new. 

[Prerequisites] should be completed before proceeding. After that, the tutorial should take no longer than 50 minutes.


### Style guide

A style guide is about making your script readable. We ask you to observe a small set of guidelines that will help us help you when you have questions about your script. 

**Comments** in R are denoted by a hash tag `#`. 

- Everything to the right of the hash tag is ignored by R. 
- Comments that describe "why" are generally more useful than comments that explain "how." 

**Spaces around operators.** Usewhitespacetoenhancereadability. Place spaces around operators (`=`, `+`, `-`, `<-`, etc.). Always put a space after a comma, but never before (just like in regular English). 

```r
# poor
height<-feet*12+inches
mean(x,na.rm=10)

# better
height <- (feet * 12) + inches
mean(x, na.rm = 10)
```

**Use vertical white space.** Lack of vertical white space makes your script harder to read (like a story with no paragraphs).  

``` r 
# Poor, no paragraph breaks
library("data.table"); library("GDAdata")
speed_ski <- copy(SpeedSki)
setDT(speed_ski)
speed_ski <- speed_ski[, .(Event, Sex, Speed)]
setnames(speed_ski, old = c("Event", "Sex", "Speed"), new = c("event", "sex", "speed"))
```

Instead, group chunks of code into paragraphs separated by blank lines to reveal the structure of the program. Comments at the start of a code chunk can explain your intent (like a topic sentence). Here we illustrate commenting on "why" rather than "how". 


``` r
# Better example with code in paragraphs

library("data.table")
library("GDAdata")

# Leave the original data unaltered before data.table conversion 
speed_ski <- copy(SpeedSki)
setDT(speed_ski)

# Only three variables are required 
speed_ski <- speed_ski[, .(Event, Sex, Speed)]

# Lowercase column names are our preferred style 
setnames(speed_ski, 
         old = c("Event", "Sex", "Speed"), 
         new = c("event", "sex", "speed"))

# RDS format preserves factors
saveRDS(speed_ski, "data/speed_ski.rds")
```

For more information of R scripting style generally see McConnell [-@McConnell:2004] and Wickham [-@Wickham:2019:styleguide].


### Open an R script

Use *File &gt; New File &gt; R Script* to create a new R script

- Name the script `01-R-basics.R`. By using a number at the start of the file name, the files stay in order in your directory.  
- Save it in the `scripts` directory.
- (optional) Add a minimal header at the top of the script, e.g.: 

```{r}
# R basics 
# 2021 ASEE Workshop: Engaging with MIDFIELD Data
# Name 
# 2021-07-26
```

- Use `library()` to load the packages we will use 

```{r}
# Packages can be loaded only if they have previously been installed
library("midfieldr")
library("data.table")

# Optional code to control data.table printing
options(
  datatable.print.nrows = 10,
  datatable.print.topn = 5,
  datatable.print.class = TRUE
)
```

Code chunks like the one above can be copied and pasted to your R script. 





### Everything in R has a name 

In R, every object has a name. 

- named entities, like `x` or `y`  
- data you have loaded, like `my_data` 
- functions you use, like `sin()` 

Some names are forbidden 

- reserved words, like `TRUE` or `FALSE`  
- programming words, like `Inf`, `for`, `else`, and `function`  
- special entities, like `NA` and `NaN`  

Some names should not be used because they name commonly used functions 

- `q()`  quit 
- `c()` combine or concatenate 
- `mean()` 
- `range()` 
- `var()` variance 

Names in R are case-sensitive 

- `my_data` and `My_Data` are different objects 
- We use the style of naming things in lower case  with words separated by underscores (no spaces), e.g., `speed_ski`. The camel-case is also popular, e.g., `SpeedSki` or `speedSki`. The choice is yours. 


If you want to know if a name has already been used in a package you have loaded, go to the RStudio console, type a question mark followed by the name, e.g., 

```r
# Type in the Console
`? c()` 
`? mean()`
```

If the name is in use, a help page appears in the RStudio Help pane.  







### Everything in R is an object 

Origins of R objects  

- Some objects are built in to R 
- Some objects are loaded with packages 
- Some objects are created by you 


Type this line of code in your script, *Save.* `c()` is the function to combine or concatenate its elements to create a vector. 

```{r echo = TRUE, results = "hide"}
# Type in the R script
c(1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 25)
```

Options for running a script:

- Select a line (or lines) and `ctrl Enter` (Mac OS `cmd Return`) 
- To run from the beginning to a line `ctrl alt B` (Mac OS `cmd option B`)

Run the script and your Console should show `[1]  1  2  3  1  3 25`. 

In these notes, when we show results printed in your Console, we preface the printout with `#>` (which does not appear on your screen) to distinguish the results from the script. For example, we show the line from above and its output like this:   

``` r
c(1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 25)          # <- typed in the script
#> [1]  1  2  3  1  3 25      # <- appears in the Console
```

The `[1]` that leads the output line is a label identifying the index of the element that starts that line. More on that in a little while.  

You create objects my assigning them names. 

- `<-` is the assignment operator, keyboard shortcut: `alt`$-$ (Mac OS `option`$-$) 

```{r}
# Practice assigning an object to a name
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 25)
y <- c(5, 31, 71, 1, 3, 21, 6)
```

To see the result in the Console, type the object name in the script, *Save*, and run.  (Remember, type the line of code but not the line prefaced by `#>`---that's the output line so you can check your results.)

```{r}
# Type in the R script or in the Console
x

y
```




Objects exist in your R project workspace, listed in the RStudio Environment pane 


```{r echo = FALSE}
htmltools::img(src = 
knitr::include_graphics("figures/rstudio-environment-x-y.png"), 
        alt = "rstudio new folder", 
        width = 700)
```

Data are also named objects. For example, midfieldr has several toy data sets included for use in illustrative examples like this one. Type its name in the script, 

```{r}
# Examine a data frame included with midfieldr
toy_student
```

To view the help page for the data, type in the Console

``` r 
# type in the Console
? toy_student
```

If we wanted the first five rows of the toy data, we use the `[]` operator.

```{r}
# Practice using the `[` operator
toy_student[1:5]
```

To view the help page for the `[` operator, surround the symbol with "back-ticks" (on your keyboard with the tilde `~` symbol). For example,  

```r
# view the help page on the R extract operator
? `[`
```
To extract a single column, e.g. the ID column, but preserve the data frame structure, 

```{r}
# Subset a column as a data table
toy_student[, .(mcid)]

```

We can also extract the column as a vector using slightly different syntax, 

```{r}
# Subset a column as a vector
toy_student[, mcid]
```

Here you can see how the row labels in the printed output work. There are 5 IDs per row, so the second row starts with the 6th ID, indicated by `[6]`. The last row starts with the 96th value `[96]` and ends with the 100th value. 

The "toy" data sets in midfieldr (`toy_student`, `toy_course`, `toy_term`, and `toy_degree`)  include student unit records for only 100 students---not a statistically representative sample---used for package examples like those above.  




### R functions do things

Functions do something useful 

- Functions are objects the perform actions for you 
- Functions produce output based on the input it receives 
- Functions are recognized by the parentheses at the end of their names 

The parentheses are where we include the inputs (arguments) to the function 

- `c()` concatenates the comma-separated numbers in the parentheses to create a vector 
- `mean()` computes the mean of a vector of numbers 
- `sd()` computes the standard deviation of a vector of numbers 
- `summary()` returns a summary of the object 

If we try `mean()` with no inputs, we get an error statement 

    mean()
    #> Error in mean.default() : argument "x" is missing, with no default

Let's determine some summary statistics on our student transfer hours. Add these lines to your script, *Save*, and run. 

```{r}
# Extract a column as a vector
transfer_hours <- toy_student[, hours_transfer]

# Examine the vector
transfer_hours

# Operate on the vector
mean(transfer_hours)
```

We have to set the optional argument `na.rm` ("remove NA") to take a mean

```{r}
# Operate and ignore NA values
mean(transfer_hours, na.rm = TRUE)

# Another operation 
sd(transfer_hours, na.rm = TRUE)

# The summary also shows the count of NAs
summary(transfer_hours)
```

Functions to examine a data frame. 

- `names()` Data frame column names 
- `head()` and `tail()` First few and last few rows of a data frame

```{r}
# Practice finding column names
names(toy_student)

# Practice examining the first few rows of a data frame
head(toy_student)

# Practice examining the last few rows of a data frame
tail(toy_student)
```

Functions to examine columns (variables) in a data frame.

- `sort()` and `unique()` often used together
- `is.na()` to return TRUE for every NA element in an object, otherwise TRUE
- `sum()` applied to `is.na()` converts logical TRUE to 1 and FALSE to 0 and adds the elements. The resulting integer is the number of NA values in the vector. 

```{r}
# Determine the unique values in a column 
sort(unique(toy_student[, sex]))

# Find the rows with NA values.
is.na(toy_student[, sex])

# How many values are NA?
sum(is.na(toy_student[, sex]))
```

Repeat for other columns. 

```{r}
# Practice examining another column
sort(unique(toy_student[, institution]))
sum(is.na(toy_student[, institution]))

# Practice examining another column
sort(unique(toy_student[, race]))
sum(is.na(toy_student[, race]))

# Practice examining another column
sort(unique(toy_student[, hours_transfer]))
sum(is.na(toy_student[, hours_transfer]))
```


The help pages for functions are accessed via the Console. By viewing the help page you can find descriptions of arguments and their default settings if any. Try a few:  

- `? mean()` 
- `? sd()` 
- `? summary()` 
- `? names()`
- `? head()`
- `? sort()` 
- `? unique()` 
- `? is.na()` 
- `? sum()` 






### R functions come in packages

Functions are bundled in packages  

- Families of useful functions are bundled into packages that you can install, load, and use 
- Packages allow you to build on the work of others 
- You can write your own functions and packages too 
- A lot of the work in data science consists of choosing the right functions and giving them the right arguments to get our data into the form we need for analysis or visualization 

For example, to see the list of functions in the midfieldr package, 

```{r}
# Showing all functions in the midfieldr package 
sort(getNamespaceExports("midfieldr"))
```

To view a help page, type, e.g., 

``` r
# Type in the Console to view a help page 
? add_race_sex() 
```

In contrast, do the same for the data.table package, 

``` r
# A package with many functions.
sort(getNamespaceExports("data.table"))
#>   [1] "%between%"          "%chin%"             "%flike%"           
#>   [4] "%ilike%"            "%inrange%"          "%like%"            
#>   [7] ".__C__data.table"   ".__C__IDate"        ".__C__ITime"       
#>  [10] ".__T__$:base"       ".__T__$<-:base"     ".__T__[:base"      
#>  [13] ".__T__[[<-:base"    ".__T__[<-:base"     ".BY"               
#>  [16] ".EACHI"             ".GRP"               ".I"                
#>  [19] ".Last.updated"      ".N"                 ".NGRP"             
#>  [22] ".rbind.data.table"  ".SD"                ":="                
#>  [25] "address"            "alloc.col"          "as.data.table"     
#>  [28] "as.IDate"           "as.ITime"           "as.xts.data.table" 
#>  [31] "between"            "chgroup"            "chmatch"           
#>  [34] "chorder"            "CJ"                 "copy"              
#>  [37] "cube"               "data.table"         "dcast"             
#>  [40] "dcast.data.table"   "fcase"              "fcoalesce"         
#>  [43] "fifelse"            "fintersect"         "first"   
#>  ... etc. truncated
```

Don't panic! We will use only a small number of these functions from data.table. For example, the `%ilike%` function, view its help page by running 


``` r
# Type in the Console to view the help page 
? `%ilike%` 
```









### R objects have class

Everything is an object and every object has a class. 

```{r}
class(x)

class(summary)
```

Certain actions will change the class of an object. Suppose we try create a vector from the `x` object and a text string, 

```{r}
new_vector <- c(x, "Apple")

new_vector

class(new_vector)
```

By adding the word "Apple" to the vector, R changed the class from "numeric" to "character". All the numbers are enclosed in quotes: they are now character strings and cannot be used in calculations. 

The most common class of data object we will use is the data frame. The data in midfieldr are stored as data frames, e.g., 

```{r}
# examine another midfieldr data set 
study_stickiness

class(study_stickiness)
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
my_names <- paste(names(study_stickiness), collapse = ", ")
```

- Six columns:  `r my_names`. 
- Three columns are labeled `<char>` for character, categorical variables   
- Two columns are labeled `<int>` for integer
- One column is labeled `<num>` for double precision 

The additional class shown `data.table` is an augmented version of the base R `data.frame` class. When working with these objects you can use base R `data.frame` syntax or data.table syntax. 

If you have a data.frame object that is not a data.table, e.g. the `airquality` data frame that comes with R

```{r}
class(airquality)

head(airquality)
```

You can convert it to  data.table object with `as.data.table()` and assign it to a _slightly) different name. 

```{r}
air_quality <- as.data.table(airquality)

class(air_quality)

air_quality
```

The data frame as a whole has a class; so do the individual columns. 

```{r}
class(air_quality[, Ozone])

class(air_quality)
```





### R objects have structure


To see inside an object ask for its structure using the `str()` function.

```{r}
str(x)

str(toy_term)

str(airquality)

str(air_quality)
```




### R only does what you tell it

Healy [-@Healy:2019] offers this advice for specific things to watch out for: 

- Make sure parentheses are balanced---that every opening `(` has a corresponding closing `)`.  
- Expect to make errors and don't worry when that happens.  You won't break anything. 
- Make sure you complete your expressions. If you see a `+` in the Console instead of the usual prompt `>`, R thinks your expression is incomplete. For example, if you type the following and try to run it, 

``` r
    str(air_quality
```

the output in your Console reports:

``` r
    #> str(air_quality
    + 
```
The plus sign indicates that the expression is incomplete...in this case a missing closing parenthesis. To recover,  hit `Esc` or `ctrl C`. Then correct the code. 

As you work through the MIDFIELD tutorials, we'll introduce syntax by example from both base R and the data.table package. There can be subtle differences that we will attempt to avoid by consistent usage. 

For example, to subset a column from a data frame but keep it as a column (not a vector), the base R syntax is 

``` r
# base R subset one column 
airquality[, "Ozone", drop = FALSE]
#>     Ozone
#> 1      41
#> 2      36
#> 3      12
#> 4      18
#> 5      NA
#> 6      28
#> 7      23
#> 8      19
#> 9       8
#> 10     NA
#> ..., etc., truncated for brevity
```

In data.table syntax, the same operation is as follows. Note we are using the  `air_quality` data.table object we created earlier.  

```{r}
# data.table extract one column 
air_quality[, .(Ozone)]
```

If we want the same information extracted as a vector, we would:

```{r}
# base R subset one column as a vector
airquality[, "Ozone"]

# data.table subset one column as a vector
air_quality[, Ozone]
```

In each case, you will note that the square bracket operators include a comma `[i, j]`. In general, the comma separates row operations `i` from column operations `j`.  When there is no row operation (as in the examples above), the `i` position is empty.  

In data table syntax, we go one step further and add a grouping index, that is

```r
DT[i, j, by]

```
This can be read as "Take DT, subset/reorder rows using `i`, then calculate `j`, grouped by `by`."  You don't have to go into it any more deeply than this for now---we will illustrate it by example in the midfieldr tutorials.

**Package main help** 

For a package's main help page, `help(package = "name_of_package")`, to obtain a list of all the functions (and possibly some data objects) in the package. 

```{r eval = FALSE}
# type in the Console
help(package = "midfieldr")
```

In the Help pane, click through any of the links for details on the function. 

**Package vignettes**

Some packages come with vignettes, articles explaining how to use the package for specific tasks. For example, 

```{r eval = FALSE}
# type in the Console
browseVignettes(package = "data.table")
browseVignettes(package = "ggplot2")

# to see a listing of all vignettes in all your installed packages
browseVignettes()
```

**Function help**

A number of times so far we've shown how to get the help page for a function when we know its name, e.g., 

```r
# type in the Console
? str()
```

If you recall only a part of the function name, use `apropos()` to search packages that are currently loaded. "Loading" a package is what we do when we use the `library()` function at the top of a script. 

For example, midfieldr has functions with "timely" in their name because they involve timely completion. `apropos()` reports two functions: 

```{r}
# type in the Console
apropos("timely")
```



**Examples**

There are often examples at the end of an R function help page. You can run them using the `example()` function. For example, 

```{r}
# base R function examples
example("mean")
```

try one of the midfieldr function examples, 

```{r}
# midfieldr function examples
example("add_institution")
```








### Keyboard shortcuts

If you are working in RStudio, you can see the menu of keyboard
shortcuts using the menu _Tools &gt; Keyboard Shortcuts Help_. The
shortcuts we use regularly include
