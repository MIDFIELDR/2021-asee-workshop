## Introduction 

This tutorial is an introduction to ggplot2 adapted from Chapter 3 from [@Healy:2019]. If you already have R experience, you might still want to browse this section in case you find something new. 

[Prerequisites] should be completed before proceeding. After that, the tutorial should take about an hour. 

Create a new script for this tutorial. 

- See [Open an R script] if you need a refresher on creating, saving, and running an R script. 
- At the top of the script add a minimal header and install and load the packages indicated.  

```{r}
# Graph basics 
# Name 
# Date 

# Packages used in this tutorial
library("midfieldr")
library("midfielddata")
library("data.table")
library("ggplot2")
library("gapminder")

# Optional code to control data.table printing
options(
  datatable.print.nrows = 10,
  datatable.print.topn = 5,
  datatable.print.class = TRUE
)

# Load midfielddata data sets to use later
data(student)
data(term) 
```

If you get an error like this one after running the script, 

        Error in library("gapminder") : there is no package called 'gapminder'

then the package needs to be installed. If you need a refresher on installing packages, see [Install CRAN packages]. Once the missing package is installed, you can rerun the script. 

Guidelines 

- As you work through the tutorial, type a line or chunk of code then *File &gt; Save* and run the script.    
- Confirm that your result matches the tutorial result.  
- The **exercises** give you chance to practice your new skills to learn by doing (but you knew that already)!
 





## Expected data structure

Data for analysis and graphing are often laid out in "block record" or "long" form with every key variable and response variable in their own columns [@Mount+Zumel:2019:fluid-data]. Database designers call this a "denormalized" form; many R users would recognize it as the so-called "tidy" form [@Wickham+Grolemund:2017].

We use this form regularly for preparing data for graphing using the ggplot2 package. The gapminder data we're using in this tutorial is in block-record form. To view its help page, run

``` r
library("gapminder")
? gapminder
```

```{r}
# Convert the data frame to a data.table structure 
gapminder <- data.table(gapminder)
```

And we can just type its name to see a few rows. Note at the top of each column under the column name, the class of the variable is shown: factor `<fctr>`, integer `<int>`, and double-precision `<num>`. 

```{r}
gapminder
```

### Exercise

- Examine the `student` data from midfielddata. (Type its name in the console.)
- How many variables? How many observations? 
- How many of the variables are numeric? How many are character type? 
- Is the data set in block-record form? 
- Check your work by comparing your result to the `student` help page (link below).   

Help pages for more information: 

- [`student`](https://midfieldr.github.io/midfielddata/reference/student.html)
- [`gapminder`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/gapminder/versions/0.3.0/topics/gapminder)




## Anatomy of a graph  

`ggplot()` is a our basic plotting function. The `data = ...` argument assigns the data frame. The plot is empty because we haven't mapped the data to coordinates yet. 

```{r fig01}
ggplot(data = gapminder)
```

Next we use the mapping argument `mapping = aes(...)` to assign variables (column names) from the data frame to specific aesthetic properties of the graph such as the x-coordinate, the y-coordinate color, fill, etc. 

Here we map continent (a categorical variable) to `x` and life expectancy (a quantitative variable) to `y`. To reduce the number of times we repeat lines of code, we can assign a name (`life_gdp`) to the empty graph to which we can add layers later.  

```{r}
# Demonstrate aesthetic mapping
life_exp <- ggplot(data = gapminder, mapping = aes(x = continent, y = lifeExp))
```

If we print the graph by typing the name of the graph object (everything in R is an object), we get a graph with a range on each axis (from the mapping) but no data shown. We haven't specified the type of visual encoding we want.  

```{r}
# Examine the result
life_exp
```

A box-and-whisker plot (or box plot) is designed for displaying the distribution of a single quantitative variable. The visual encoding is specified using the `geom_boxplot()` layer, where a "geom" is a geometric object. The `geom_boxplot()` function requires the quantitative variable assigned to `y` and the categorical variable (if any) to `x`. 

```{r}
# Demonstrate adding a geometric object 
life_exp <- life_exp + 
  geom_boxplot()

# Examine the result
life_exp
```
 

Notice that the default axis labels are the variables names from the data frame. We can edit those with another layer 

```{r}
# Demonstrate editing axis labels
life_exp <- life_exp + 
  labs(x = "Continent", y = "Life expectancy (years)")

# Examine the result
life_exp
```

You can always write all the layers in one code chunk and obtain the same result.

```{r}
# Demonstrate all layers in one code chunk 
p <-  ggplot(data = gapminder, mapping = aes(x = continent, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "Continent", y = "Life expectancy (years)")
```

To reduce typing, the first two arguments `data` and `mapping` are often used without naming them explicitly, e.g., 

```{r}
# Demonstrate implicit data and mapping arguments
life_exp <-  ggplot(gapminder, aes(x = continent, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "Continent", y = "Life expectancy (years)")
```

Next, we often want the categorical variable ordered by the quantitative variable instead of alphabetically. Because `continent` is a factor, we can use the `reorder()` function inside the `aes()` argument. 

```{r}
# Demonstrate reordering a categorical variable 
life_exp + 
  aes(x = reorder(continent, lifeExp), y = lifeExp)
```


Summary. The basics steps for building up the layers of any graph consist of, 

- assign the data frame 
- map variables (columns names) to aesthetic properties  
- choose geoms  
- adjust scales, labels, ordering, etc. 

### Exercise 

- Examine the `term` data set from midfielddata. 
- Create a boxplot of the hours per term quantity conditioned by the student level. 
- What is the rational for leaving the categorical variable in its native order? 
- Check your work by comparing your result to the graph below. 

```{r echo = FALSE}
ggplot(term, aes(y = hours_term, x = level)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "Level", y = "Hours per term")
```

- [`geom_boxplot()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_boxplot.html) 
- [`geom_labs()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/labs.html)  




## Layer: points

A two-dimensional scatterplot reveals the strength of the relationship between two quantitative variables. The ggplot geom for scatterplots is `geom_point()`. To illustrate a scatterplot, we graph life expectancy as a function of GDP. 

```{r}
life_gdp <- ggplot(gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "GDP per capita (USD)", y = "Life expectancy (years)")

life_gdp
```


Help pages for more information: 

- [`geom_point()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_point.html)


    
    
    
    
    

## Layer: smooth fit

Suppose you wanted a smooth fit curve, not necessarily linear. Add a  `geom_smooth()` layer. The name *loess* (pronounced like the proper name Lois) is a nonparametric curve-fitting method based on *local regression*. 

```{r}
life_gdp + 
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", se = FALSE)
```

The `se` argument controls whether or not the confidence interval is displayed. Setting `se = TRUE` yields, 

```{r}
life_gdp + 
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", se = TRUE)
```

For a linear-fit layer, we add a layer with `method` set to `lm` (short for linear model). The linear fit is not particularly good in this case, but now you know how to do one. 

```{r}
life_gdp + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = TRUE)
```


Help pages for more information: 

- [geom_smooth()](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_smooth.html) 

   
   
   
   
   
   
### Exercise

```{r include = FALSE}
# # We only need two columns for the plot
# cols_we_want <- c("sat_math", "sat_verbal")
# sat <- student[, ..cols_we_want]
# 
# # Before sampling, we remove NA values 
# sat <- na.omit(sat)
# 
# # We sample to reduce computational time 
# sat <- sat[sample(nrow(sat), 3000)]
# 
# fwrite(sat, "data/sat.csv")
```

A data set has been extracted from the midfieldr `student` table with a sample of 3000 student SAT scores. Download the file using the data.table  `fread()` function as follows: 

```{r}
data_url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MIDFIELDR/2021-asee-workshop/main/data/sat.csv"
sat <- fread(data_url)
```

- Use the `sat` data frame and create a scatterplot of verbal scores `sat_verbal` as a function of math scores `sat_math`.     
- Add a loess fit.     
- Check your work by comparing your result to the graph below.

```{r echo = FALSE}
ggplot(sat, aes(x = sat_math, y = sat_verbal)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", se = FALSE) +
  labs(x = "SAT math score", y = "SAT verbal score")
```







## Layer: scale

```{r echo = FALSE}
options(scipen = 999)
```

We have orders of magnitude differences in the GDP per capita variable. To confirm, we can create a `summary()` of the `gdpPercap`  variable. The output shows that the minimum is `r round(min(gapminder[["gdpPercap"]]), 0)`, the median  `r round(median(gapminder[["gdpPercap"]]), 0)`, and the maximum  `r round(max(gapminder[["gdpPercap"]]), 0)`. 

```{r}
# statistical summary of one variable 
summary(gapminder[, gdpPercap])
```

In exploring a graph like this, it might be useful to add a layer that changes the horizontal scale to a log-base-10 scale. 

```{r}
life_gdp <- life_gdp +
  scale_x_continuous(trans = "log10") 
```

Update the axis labels, 

```{r}
life_gdp <- life_gdp +
  labs(x = "GDP per capita, USD (log10 scale)", 
       y = "Life expectancy (years)")

life_gdp # display the graph
```

In summary, all the layers could have been be coded at once, for example, 

```{r eval = FALSE}
ggplot(gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_continuous(trans = "log10") +
  labs(x = "GDP per capita, USD (log10 scale)", 
       y = "Life expectancy (years)")
```

With all the layers in one place, we can see that we've coded all the basic steps, that is, 

- assign the data frame  
- map variables (columns names) to aesthetic properties  
- choose geoms  
- adjust scales, labels, ordering, etc.  





### Exercise

The midfieldr `student` table has been summarized by counting the number of students by race/ethnicity and sex, omitting "International" and "Other/Unknown" race values. 

```{r include = FALSE}
# Access a data set included with midfieldr
DT <- copy(student)[, .(race, sex)]

# Create a combined categorical column
DT[, race_sex := paste(race, sex)]
DT[, c("race", "sex") := NULL]

# Sum the number of students by this category
DT <- DT[, .N, by = "race_sex"]
DT <- DT[!race_sex %ilike% "Other|International"]

# Factor class enables reordering
DT[, race_sex := factor(race_sex)]
DT[, race_sex := reorder(race_sex, N)]
student_demogr <- copy(DT)
fwrite(student_demogr, file = "data/student_demogr.csv")
```

Download the file

```{r}
read_url <- function(url, ...){
  tmpFile <- tempfile()
  download.file(url, destfile = tmpFile, method = "curl")
  url.data <- fread(tmpFile, ...)
  return(url.data)
}

read_url("https://github.com/MIDFIELDR/2021-asee-workshop/blob/main/data/student_demogr.csv")

```

- Use the resulting `dtf` data frame to graph `ever` on the x-axis with `race_sex` on the y-axis.    
- Reorder `race_sex` by `ever`.    
- Use a log-base-2 scale.    
- You can omit the y-axis label by setting `y = ""` in the `labs()` argument.    
- Check your work by comparing your result to the graph below.

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.asp = 1/3}
ggplot(student_demogr, aes(x = N, y = race_sex)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_continuous(trans = "log2") +
  labs(x = "Number of students admitted (log-2 scale)", y = "")
```

Help pages for more information:  

- [scale_x_continuous()](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/scale_continuous.html) 





## Mapping columns to aesthetics 

Mappings in the `aes()` function of `ggplot()` can involve the names of variables (column s) only. So far, the only mappings we've used are from column names to an x or y aesthetic.  

Another useful mapping is from a column name to the `color` argument, which then separates the data by the values of the categorical variable selected and automatically creates the appropriate legend. 

Here we map the `continent` column to the `color` aesthetic, adding a third data variable to the display.  

```{r}
ggplot(gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, color = continent)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_continuous(trans = "log10") +
  labs(x = "GDP per capita, USD (log10 scale)", 
       y = "Life expectancy (years)")
```


### Exercise 

Use the following code chunk to construct a data frame with hours per term and level from `term` merged with `sex` data from `student`. Again, we leave explanations of the data manipulation to the [Data basics] tutorial.

```{r}
dtf <- add_race_sex(term, 
                    midfield_student = student)
cols_we_want <- c("mcid", "term", "hours_term", "level", "sex")
dtf <- dtf[, ..cols_we_want]
dtf <- unique(dtf)
```

- Use the resulting `dtf` data frame to a boxplot of hours per term as a function of level like we did earlier. 
- Add a third column name to `aes()` to add `sex` by color to the graph. 
- Add the `coord_flip()` layer to your graph to swap the position of the x, y coordinates to obtain a horizontal boxplot. 
- Check your work by comparing your result to the graph below.

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.asp = 1/1.6}
ggplot(dtf, aes(y = hours_term, x = level, color = sex)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "Level", y = "Hours per term") +
  coord_flip()
```

- [`coord_flip()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/coord_flip.html)









## Layer: facets 

In the earlier graph where we mapped continent to color, there was a lot of overprinting, making it difficult to compare the continents. Instead of using color to distinguish the continents, we can plot in different panels by continent. 

The `facet_wrap()` layer separates the data into different panels (or facets). Like the `aes()` mapping, `facet_wrap()` is applied to a variable (column name) in the data frame. 

```{r}
life_gdp <- life_gdp + 
  facet_wrap(facets = vars(continent))

life_gdp # print the graph
```

Comparisons are facilitated by having the facets appear in one column, by using the `ncol` argument of `facet_wrap()`. 

```{r L505, fig.asp = 1.5}
life_gdp <- life_gdp + facet_wrap(facets = vars(continent), ncol = 1)

life_gdp # print the graph
```

In a faceted display, all panels have identical scales (the default) to facilitate comparison. Again, all the layers could have been be coded at once, for example, 

```{r L512, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +
  facet_wrap(facets = vars(continent), ncol = 1) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_continuous(trans = "log10") +
  labs(x = "GDP per capita, USD (log10 scale)", 
       y = "Life expectancy (years)") 
```

### Exercise

Use the following code chunk to construct a data frame of program stickiness by program, race/ethnicity, and sex. 

```{r}
# Access a data set included with midfieldr
stickiness <- copy(study_stickiness)

# Create a combined categorical column 
stickiness[, race_sex := paste(race, sex)]

# Factor class enables reordering 
stickiness[, race_sex := factor(race_sex)]
stickiness[, program := factor(program)]

# Omit ambiguous race/ethnicities and small populations
stickiness <- stickiness[!race_sex %ilike% c("Native|International|Other")]
```

- Use the resulting `dtf` data frame plot stickiness (x-axis) as a function of race/ethnicity/sex (y-axis) and faceted by program.  
- When that graph seems OK, add a third column name to `aes()` to add `sex` by color to the graph. 
- Check your work by comparing your result to the graph below.

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.asp = 1/1}
ggplot(stickiness, aes(x = stick, 
                y = race_sex, 
                color = sex)) +
  facet_wrap(facets = vars(program), ncol = 1) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(y = "", x = "Stickiness (%)")
```


Help pages for more information: 

- [facet_wrap()](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/facet_wrap.html) 








## Ordering panels and rows

Panels (facets) by default are nearly always ordered alphabetically. In most cases, ordering the panels by the data improves the display. Earlier, we used `reorder()` to order a set of boxplots. This function operates correctly on "factor" variables only. 

A factor is special data structure in R for categorical variables. In a factor, the levels of the category---typically character strings---are known and fixed. However, factors are stored internally as integers---a critical design tool for meaningfully ordering the rows and panels of a display involving categorical variables.

In the gapminder data, the `continent` column is already a factors. 

```{r}
gapminder
```

We can reorder the levels of the factor before graphing as follows, 

```{r}
gapminder[, continent := reorder(continent, lifeExp)]
```

Then graph using much the same code chunk as before with one addition. We add the `as.table = FALSE` argument to the `facet_wrap()` function. "Table-order" of panels is increasing from top to bottom; "graph-order" increases (like a graph scale) from bottom to top.

```{r fig.asp = 1.5}
ggplot(gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +
  facet_wrap(facets = vars(continent), ncol = 1, as.table = FALSE) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_continuous(trans = "log10") +
  labs(x = "GDP per capita, USD (log10 scale)", 
       y = "Life expectancy (years)") 
```


### Exercise

- Continue using the `stickiness` data frame from the previous section.  
- Order the panels by the stickiness variable. 
- Order race/ethnicity/sex by the stickiness variable. 
- Check your work by comparing your result to the graph below.

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.asp = 1/1}
stickiness[, program := reorder(program, stick)]
stickiness[, race_sex := reorder(race_sex, stick)]
ggplot(stickiness, aes(x = stick, 
                y = race_sex, 
                color = sex)) +
  facet_wrap(facets = vars(program), ncol = 1, as.table = FALSE) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(y = "", x = "Stickiness (%)")
```
