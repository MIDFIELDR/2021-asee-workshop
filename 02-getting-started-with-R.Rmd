If you already have R and RStudio installed, please update to the most recent releases and update your R packages as well.

If you are trying R for the first time, it is vital that you attempt to set up your computer with the necessary software in advance or it will be difficult to keep up. 

## Why R? {-} 

```{r}
# if internet available, find and save current number of R packages
library("pingr")
if (pingr::is_online()) {
	n_pkg <- nrow(available.packages(contrib.url("https://cloud.r-project.org/")))
	# round down to nearest 250
	n_pkg <- 250 * floor(n_pkg / 250)
	n_pkg <- format(n_pkg, big.mark = ",", trim = TRUE, digits = 0, scientific = FALSE)
	date_pkg <- format(Sys.Date(), "%b %Y")
	info_pkg <- c(n_pkg, date_pkg)
	saveRDS(info_pkg, "data/info_pkg.rds")
}

# use saved values 
info_pkg <- readRDS("data/info_pkg.rds")
n_pkg    <- info_pkg[1]
date_pkg <- info_pkg[2]
```

R is an open source language and environment for statistical computing and graphics [@R-base], ranked by IEEE in 2020 as the 6th most popular programming language (Python, Java, and C are the top three) [@Cass:2020]. If you are new to R, some of its best features, paraphrasing Wickham  [-@wickham2014advanced], are: 

- R is free, open source, and available on every major platform, making it easy for others to replicate your work.
- More than `r n_pkg` open-source R packages are available (`r date_pkg`). Many are cutting-edge tools. 
- R packages provide deep-seated support for data analysis, e.g., missing values, data frames, and subsetting.

RStudio, an integrated development environment (IDE) for R, includes a console, editor, and tools for plotting, history, debugging, and workspace management as well as access to GitHub for collaboration and version control  [@2016rstudio]. 


## Install R and RStudio {- #install-R-and-RStudio}

Unless noted otherwise, we assume the reader is an R novice. Thus the first steps are to install R and RStudio. 

Windows users may have to login as an Administrator (localmgr) before installing the software. 

- [Install R](https://cloud.r-project.org){target="_blank"} for your operating system  
- [Install RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/#Desktop){target="_blank"}, a user interface for R
