## Objectives {-} 

The main goal of the workshop is making MIDFIELD more accessible to the ASEE community. The workshop introduces *midfieldr* (a package in the R software environment) that provides access to a MIDFIELD student-record data sample and tools to analyze and graph persistence metrics such as graduation rates. The workshop is designed for R beginners. 

By the end of the workshop, participants should be able to:

- Describe key variables in MIDFIELD 
- Select academic programs and populations to study
- Use midfieldr, an R package specifically designed for use with MIDFIELD, to compute persistence metrics
- Explore and tell a story from MIDFIELD data
- Explain key features of effective data displays 

## Description {-} 

The robustness of the MIDFIELD data allows us to emphasize an intersectional approach to the study of student records, permitting multiple categories of inequity such as race/ethnicity and sex to be considered simultaneously. 

To introduce beginners to R, participants work through a self-paced tutorial covering basic elements of the R computing language and environment. To introduce midfieldr and using it to work with student record data, participants work through a "Get started" tutorial in which they determine the numbers of students ever enrolled in two programs, group and summarize the data, and graph the results. 

For more experienced R users or anyone working at a faster pace, we offer a series of self-paced tutorials that introduce key features of midfieldr and how they are applied to compute persistence metrics and graph results. 

We also discuss the merits of the multiway graph design that is recommended for displaying results of this type. The agenda includes an interactive session to demonstrate contemporary principles of effective data display.
