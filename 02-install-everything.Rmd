If you are trying R for the first time, it is vital that you attempt to set up your computer with the necessary software in advance or it will be difficult to keep up. 

Your pre-workshop homework:  

- 2.1 [Install R and RStudio]
- 2.2 [Install packages we need]
- 2.3 [Install midfielddata] 
- 2.4 [Install midfieldr] 
- 3.1 [Create a project]  
- 3.2 [Add some folders] 

If you already have R and RStudio installed, this is a great time to 

- Make sure your R installation is current
- Make sure your RStudio installation is current
- Update your packages by running: 

```r
update.packages(ask = FALSE, checkBuilt = TRUE)

```


## Install R and RStudio 

The first steps are to install R and RStudio. Windows users may have to login as an Administrator before installing the software. 

- [Install R](https://cloud.r-project.org){target="_blank"} for your operating system  
- [Install RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/#Desktop){target="_blank"}, a user interface for R  

Once the installation is complete, you can take a 2-minute tour of the RStudio interface.

The same video includes a longer (7 minute) tour of the four quadrants (panes) in RStudio if you are interested.

## Create a project 

To begin any project, we create an RStudio *Project* file and directory. You can recognize an R project file by its *.Rproj* suffix. 

If you prefer your instructions with commentary, 

- [Start with a Project (02:34--04:50)](https://www.youtube.com/embed/kfcX5DEMAp4?start=154&end=290){target="_blank"} by R Ladies Sydney [@RLadiesSydney:2018:Lesson1] 


If you prefer basic written instructions, 

- RStudio, *File &gt; New Project... &gt; New Directory &gt; New Project* 
- Or, click the *New Project* button in the Console ribbon, 


```{r echo = FALSE}
htmltools::img(src = knitr::include_graphics("figures/rstudio-new-project.png"), 
        alt   = "rstudio new project button", 
        style = "left:0px; padding:20px;", 
        width = "700px")
```

<br>
In the dialog box that appears, 
  
- Type the workshop name as the directory name, for example, `workshop`, or if you like more detail, `midfield-workshop-asee-2021`    
- Use the browse button to select a location on your computer to create the project  folder  
- Click the *Create Project* button  
 





Whenever you work with the workshop materials, launch the `workshop.Rproj` file (using the name you actually used) to start the session. 




## Add some folders 

While file organization is a matter of personal preference, we ask that you use the directory structure shown here for your work in the workshop. Assuming we called our project `workshop`, the minimal directory structure has three folders in it plus the `.Rproj` file at the top level. 

```r
\workshop
    \data
    \results
    \scripts
    workshop.Rproj
```

We use the folders as follows: 

- `data` data files 
- `results` finished graphs and tabulated data formatted for display  
- `scripts` R scripts that operate on data to produce results  

If you prefer your instructions with commentary,  

- [Make some folders  (04:50--06:08)](https://www.youtube.com/embed/kfcX5DEMAp4?start=290&end=368){target="_blank"} by R Ladies Sydney [@RLadiesSydney:2018:Lesson1] 

If you prefer basic written instructions, 

- use your usual method of creating new folders on your machine 
- or you can use the *New Folder* button in the Files pane 

```{r echo = FALSE}
htmltools::img(src = knitr::include_graphics("figures/rstudio-new-folder.png"), 
        alt   = "rstudio new folder", 
        style = "left:0px; padding:20px;", 
        width = "700px")
```

## Create a library for packages

Packages are like “apps” for R. As Hadley Wickham states, “Packages are the fundamental units
of reproducible R code. They include reusable functions, the
documentation that describes how to use them, and sample data.”

If we store packages in a library separate from the base R installation,
then when you update R, you don’t have to reinstall every package,
saving a lot of time. 

If you happen to be working with R on a network, storing your library locally can save you time tracking down obscure problems that R has with network drives as well. 

At the top level of your drive, create a new directory (folder) named
“R”. In that directory create a new folder named “library”, for
example,

  - Windows: `C:/R/library`  
  - Mac OS and Linux: `~/R/library`

  
## Create the .Renviron file

The `.Renviron` file is a text file that directs R packages to be
installed in the `R/library` directory created earlier. To create the
file, with RStudio open,

  - Create a new text file, *File menu \> New File \> Text File*.
  - Save the file to the `workshop` main directory using the filename
    *.Renviron*

In this file, write the following line of text that tells R the path to
the stand-alone package library you created earlier.

  - Windows: `R_LIBS_USER="C:/R/library"`
  - Mac OS and Linux: `R_LIBS_USER="~/R/library"`

Save and close to recognize the .Renviron file.

  - Save and close the `.Renviron` file.
  - Close RStudio

Let’s check your project directory. You should have at least the
following folders and files,

```r
\workshop
    \data
    \results
    \scripts
    .Renviron
    workshop.Rproj
```

Remember, every time you create a new project, paste a copy of the `.Renviron` file at the top level of the project directory.  
  
  
  




## Install packages we need

The fundamental unit of shareable code in R is the *package.* For the R novice, an R package is like an "app" for R---a collection of functions, data, and documentation for doing work in R that is easily shared with others  [@wickham2014advanced]. 

Most packages are obtained from the [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/){target="_blank"} website [@cranweb]. To install a CRAN package using RStudio:

- Launch RStudio 

The RStudio interface has several panes. We want the *Files/Plots/Packages* pane. 

- Select the *Packages*  tab  

```{r echo = FALSE}
htmltools::img(src = knitr::include_graphics("figures/rstudio-packages.png"), 
        alt   = "rstudio packages pane", 
        style = "left:0px; padding:20px;", 
        width = "700px")
```

<br>
Next, 

- Click *Install* on the ribbon 
- In the dialog box, type the name of the package. For our first package, type  `data.table` to install the data.table package [@R-data.table]
- Check the *Install dependencies* box 
- Click the  *Install* button 

In the RStudio Console, you should see a message like this one,  

```r
    package 'data.table' successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked
```

If successful, the package will appear in the Packages pane, e.g., 

```{r echo = FALSE}
htmltools::img(src = knitr::include_graphics("figures/rstudio-packages-3.png"), 
        alt   = "rstudio packages pane", 
        style = "left:0px; padding:20px;", 
        width = "700px")
```

Repeat the process for the following packages

    wrapr 
    Rdpack 
    checkmate

Alternatively, you can install them all at once by typing in the Console: 

``` r
# midfieldr depends on these packages
packages_we_need <- c("data.table", "wrapr", "Rdpack", "checkmate")
install.packages(packages_we_need)
```






## Install midfieldr {#install-midfieldr}

During the installation, Windows users might get a warning message about Rtools, something like the following. You may ignore the warning and carry on. 


    WARNING: Rtools is required to build R packages but is not currently installed. 
    Please download and install the appropriate version...


midfieldr is not yet available from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/). To install the development version of midfieldr from its `drat` repository, type in the Console: 

``` r
# install midfieldr from drat repo
install.packages("midfieldr", 
                 repos = "https://MIDFIELDR.github.io/drat/", 
                 type = "source")
```

You can confirm a successful installation by running the following lines to bring up the package help page in the Help window. 

``` r
library("midfieldr")
help("midfieldr-package")
```

If the installation is successful, the code chunk above should produce a view of the help page as shown here. 

```{r echo = FALSE}
htmltools::img(src = knitr::include_graphics("figures/README-midfieldr-help-page-2.png"), 
        alt   = "midfiedr help page pane", 
        style = "left:0px; padding:20px;", 
        width = "700px")
```









## Install midfielddata  {#install-midfielddata}

Because of its size, the data package is stored in a `drat` repository instead of CRAN. Installation takes time; please be patient and wait for the Console prompt ">" to reappear. 

Type (or copy and paste) the following lines in the RStudio Console. 

```r
# type in the RStudio Console  
install.packages("midfielddata", 
                 repos = "https://MIDFIELDR.github.io/drat/", 
                 type = "source")
# be patient
```

Once the Console prompt ">" reappears, you can confirm a successful installation by viewing the package help page. In the Console, run:

```r
# type in the RStudio Console  
library("midfielddata")
help("midfielddata-package")
```

If the installation is successful, the code chunk above should produce a view of the help page as shown here.  

```{r echo = FALSE}
htmltools::img(src = knitr::include_graphics("figures/README-midfielddata-help-page-2.png"), 
        alt   = "midfiedldata help page pane", 
        style = "left:0px; padding:20px;", 
        width = "700px")
```



If this step is successful, please continue your homework by completing: 

- 3.1 [Create a project]  
- 3.2 [Add some folders]
