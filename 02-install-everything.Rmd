If you are trying R for the first time, it is vital that you attempt to set up your computer with the necessary software in advance or it will be difficult to keep up. 

Your pre-workshop homework:  

- 2.1 [Install R and RStudio]
- 2.2 [Install the remotes package]
- 2.3 [Install midfielddata] 
- 2.4 [Install midfieldr] 
- 3.1 [Create a project]  
- 3.2 [Add some folders] 

If you already have R and RStudio installed, this is a great time to 

- Make sure your R installation is current
- Make sure your RStudio installation is current
- Update your packages by running: 

```r
update.packages(ask = FALSE, checkBuilt = TRUE)

```


## Install R and RStudio 

The first steps are to install R and RStudio. Windows users may have to login as an Administrator before installing the software. 

- [Install R](https://cloud.r-project.org){target="_blank"} for your operating system  
- [Install RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/#Desktop){target="_blank"}, a user interface for R  

Once the installation is complete, you can take a 2-minute tour of the RStudio interface.

The same video includes a longer (7 minute) tour of the four quadrants (panes) in RStudio if you are interested.

## Install the remotes package 

The fundamental unit of shareable code in R is the *package.* For the R novice, an R package is like an "app" for R---a collection of functions, data, and documentation for doing work in R that is easily shared with others  [@wickham2014advanced]. 

Most packages are obtained from the [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/){target="_blank"} website [@cranweb]. To install a CRAN package using RStudio:

- Launch RStudio 

The RStudio interface has several panes. We want the *Files/Plots/Packages* pane. 

- Select the *Packages*  tab  

```{r echo = FALSE}
htmltools::img(src = knitr::include_graphics("figures/rstudio-packages.png"), 
        alt   = "rstudio packages pane", 
        style = "left:0px; padding:20px;", 
        width = "700px")
```

<br>
Next, 

- Click *Install* on the ribbon 
- In the dialog box, type the name of the package. For our first package, type  `remotes` to install the remotes package [@R-remotes]
- Check the *Install dependencies* box 
- Click the  *Install* button 

In the RStudio Console, you should see a message like this one,  

```r
    package 'remotes' successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked
```

If successful, the package will appear in the Packages pane, e.g., 

```{r echo = FALSE}
htmltools::img(src = knitr::include_graphics("figures/rstudio-packages-2.png"), 
        alt   = "rstudio packages pane", 
        style = "left:0px; padding:20px;", 
        width = "700px")
```

## Install midfieldr {#install-midfieldr}

Earlier we installed the remotes package. To access its functions we use the `library()` function. 

```r
# type in the RStudio Console  
library("remotes")
```

Now we can use the `install_github()` function in the remotes package to install the midfieldr package from GitHub [@R-midfieldr].

```r
# type in the RStudio Console  
install_github("MIDFIELDR/midfieldr")
```

You can confirm a successful installation by viewing the package help page. In the Console, run:

```r
# type in the RStudio Console 
library("midfieldr")
? midfieldr
```

If the installation is successful, the code chunk above should produce a view of the help page as shown here. 

```{r echo = FALSE}
htmltools::img(src = knitr::include_graphics("figures/README-midfieldr-help-page-2.png"), 
        alt   = "midfiedr help page pane", 
        style = "left:0px; padding:20px;", 
        width = "700px")
```


## Install midfielddata  {#install-midfielddata}

Because of its size, the data package is stored in a `drat` repository instead of CRAN. Installation takes time; please be patient and wait for the Console prompt ">" to reappear. 

Type (or copy and paste) the following lines in the RStudio Console. 

```r
# type in the RStudio Console  
install.packages("midfielddata", 
                 repos = "https://MIDFIELDR.github.io/drat/", 
                 type = "source")
# be patient
```

Once the Console prompt ">" reappears, you can confirm a successful installation by viewing the package help page. In the Console, run:

```r
# type in the RStudio Console  
library("midfielddata")
? midfielddata
```

If the installation is successful, the code chunk above should produce a view of the help page as shown here.  

```{r echo = FALSE}
htmltools::img(src = knitr::include_graphics("figures/README-midfielddata-help-page-2.png"), 
        alt   = "midfiedldata help page pane", 
        style = "left:0px; padding:20px;", 
        width = "700px")
```



If this step is successful, please continue your homework by completing: 

- 3.1 [Create a project]  
- 3.2 [Add some folders]
