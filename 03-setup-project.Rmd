        alt    = "logo", 
        style  = "left:0px; padding:5px;", 
        height = "110px")

To begin any project, we create an RStudio *Project* file and directory. You can recognize an R project file by its *.Rproj* suffix. 

## Create a project 

If you prefer your instructions with commentary, 

- [Start with a Project (02:34--04:50)](https://www.youtube.com/embed/kfcX5DEMAp4?start=154&end=290){target="_blank"} by R Ladies Sydney [@RLadiesSydney:2018:Lesson1] 


If you prefer basic written instructions, 

- RStudio, *File &gt; New Project... &gt; New Directory &gt; New Project* 
- Or, click the *New Project* button in the Console ribbon, 


```{r echo = FALSE}
htmltools::img(src = knitr::include_graphics("figures/rstudio-new-project.png"), 
        alt   = "rstudio new project button", 
        style = "left:0px; padding:20px;", 
        width = "700px")
```

In the dialog box that appears, 
  
- Type the workshop name as the directory name, for example, `workshop`, or if you like more detail, `midfield-workshop-asee-2021`    
- Use the browse button to select a location on your computer to create the project  folder  
- Click the *Create Project* button  
 





Whenever you work with the workshop materials, launch the `workshop.Rproj` file (using the name you actually used) to start the session. 




## Add some folders 

While file organization is a matter of personal preference, we ask that you use the directory structure shown here for your work in the workshop. Assuming we called our project `workshop`, the minimal directory structure has three folders in it plus the `.Rproj` file at the top level. 

```r
\workshop
    \data
    \results
    \scripts
    workshop.Rproj
```

We use the folders as follows: 

- `data` data files 
- `results` finished graphs and tabulated data formatted for display  
- `scripts` R scripts that operate on data to produce results

If you prefer basic written instructions, 

- use your usual method of creating new folders on your machine 
- or you can use the *New Folder* button in the Files pane 

```{r echo = FALSE}
htmltools::img(src = knitr::include_graphics("figures/rstudio-new-folder.png"), 
        alt   = "rstudio new folder", 
        style = "left:0px; padding:20px;", 
        width = "700px")
```

You finished your homework!
