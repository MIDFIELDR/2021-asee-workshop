\section{Objectives}\label{objectives}}

\href{https://engineering.purdue.edu/MIDFIELD}{\textbf{MIDFIELD}} contains individual Student Unit Record (SUR) data for 1.7M students at 33 US institutions (as of June 2021). MIDFIELD is large enough to permit grouping and summarizing by multiple characteristics, enabling researchers to examine student characteristics (race/ethnicity, sex, prior achievement) and curricular pathways (including coursework and major) by institution and over time.

The goal of this workshop is to engage ASEE members with MIDFIELD data, in part using two R packages: \href{https://midfieldr.github.io/midfieldr/}{\textbf{midfieldr}} to provide tools for working with SURs and \href{https://midfieldr.github.io/midfielddata/}{\textbf{midfielddata}} to provide practice data.

By the end of the workshop, participants should be able to:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Describe key variables in MIDFIELD data tables
\item
  Explore and tell a story from MIDFIELD data
\item
  Begin using R, midfieldr, and midfielddata\\
\item
  Explain key features of effective data displays
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{description}{%
\section{Description}\label{description}}

The robustness of the MIDFIELD data allows us to emphasize an intersectional approach to the study of student records, permitting multiple categories of inequity such as race/ethnicity and sex to be considered simultaneously.

To introduce beginners to R, participants work through a self-paced tutorial covering basic elements of the R computing language and environment. To introduce midfieldr and using it to work with student record data, participants work through software tutorials that explore the SUR data and develop a persistence metric case study.

For more experienced R users or anyone working at a faster pace, we offer a series of self-paced tutorials that introduce key features of midfieldr and how they are applied to compute persistence metrics and graph results.

We also discuss the merits of the multiway graph design that is recommended for displaying results of this type. The agenda includes an interactive session to demonstrate contemporary principles of effective data display.

\hypertarget{pre-workshop-homework}{%
\section{Pre-workshop homework}\label{pre-workshop-homework}}

To get the most out of the workshop, you should have the essential software installed and running several days before the workshop to give you time to contact us with questions if anything goes amiss.

\hypertarget{install-everything}{%
\chapter{Install everything}\label{install-everything}}

If you are trying R for the first time, it is vital that you attempt to set up your computer with the necessary software in advance or it will be difficult to keep up.

This chapter describes all of the pre-workshop homework:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \protect\hyperlink{already-installed}{Already installed?}
\item
  \protect\hyperlink{install-r-and-rstudio}{Install R and RStudio}
\item

\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{already-installed}{%
\section{Already installed?}\label{already-installed}}

If you do not have R and RStudio installed, please skip this section and start with the next section. If you are already an R and RStudio user, this is a great time to check for updates.

\textbf{Updating RStudio}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  RStudio menu \emph{Help \textgreater{} Check for Updates} will tell you if you are current or not.
\item
  To update, close RStudio on your machine, download the new version from the \href{https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/\#Desktop}{RStudio website}, and run the \texttt{RStudio-some-version-number.exe}. (Windows users \emph{might} have to run the executable as an administrator.)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Update your packages}

\href{https://rstats.wtf/maintaining-r.html\#how-to-upgrade-all-out-of-date-packages}{How to upgrade all out-of-date packages} in \emph{What They Forgot to Teach You About R} by Jennifer Bryan and Jim Hester.

\textbf{Updating R}

The easiest way to update R is to simply \href{https://cloud.r-project.org/}{download the newest version}. RStudio will automatically use the latest you've installed.

Alternatively, Windows users can use the installr package:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Install the installr package
\item
  If open, close R and RStudio
\item
  Navigate to your most recent \texttt{Rgui.exe} file located in your Programs directory, e.g., \texttt{C:\textbackslash{}Program\ Files\textbackslash{}R\textbackslash{}R-4.0.0\textbackslash{}bin\textbackslash{}x64\textbackslash{}Rgui.exe}\\
\item
  Right-click on \texttt{Rgui.exe} and run as administrator
\item
  In the R GUI window that appears, run the commands
\end{itemize}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
    \CommentTok{\# Windows users only}
    \FunctionTok{library}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"installr"}\NormalTok{)}
    \FunctionTok{updateR}\NormalTok{()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\textbf{Updating your R library}

\href{https://rstats.wtf/maintaining-r.html\#how-to-transfer-your-library-when-updating-r}{How to transfer your library when updating R} also by Bryan and Hester. Requires the fs package.

\textbf{Once your updates are complete}

Skip the next section and continue the homework with

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \protect\hyperlink{create-a-project}{Create a project}\\
\item
  \protect\hyperlink{add-some-folders}{Add some folders}
\item
  \protect\hyperlink{install-cran-packages}{Install CRAN packages}
\item
  \protect\hyperlink{install-midfield-packages}{Install MIDFIELD packages}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{install-r-and-rstudio}{%
\section{Install R and RStudio}\label{install-r-and-rstudio}}

The first steps are to install R and RStudio. Windows users may have to login as an Administrator before installing the software.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \href{https://cloud.r-project.org}{Install R} for your operating system\\
\item
  \href{https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/\#Desktop}{Install RStudio}, a user interface for R
\end{itemize}

Once the installation is complete, you can take a 2-minute tour of the RStudio interface.

\end{itemize}

The same video includes a longer (7 minute) tour of the four quadrants (panes) in RStudio if you are interested.

\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{create-a-project}{%
\section{Create a project}\label{create-a-project}}

To begin any project, we create an RStudio \emph{Project} file and directory. You can recognize an R project file by its \emph{.Rproj} suffix.

If you prefer your instructions with commentary,

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \href{https://www.youtube.com/embed/kfcX5DEMAp4?start=154\&end=290}{Start with a Project (02:34--04:50)} by R Ladies Sydney \citep{RLadiesSydney:2018:Lesson1}
\end{itemize}

If you prefer basic written instructions,

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  RStudio, \emph{File \textgreater{} New Project\ldots{} \textgreater{} New Directory \textgreater{} New Project}
\item
  Or, click the \emph{New Project} button in the Console ribbon,
\end{itemize}

In the dialog box that appears,

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Type the workshop name as the directory name, for example, \texttt{workshop}, or if you like more detail, \texttt{midfield-workshop-asee-2021}\\
\item
  Use the browse button to select a location on your computer to create the project folder\\
\item
  Click the \emph{Create Project} button
\end{itemize}

Whenever you work with the workshop materials, launch the \texttt{workshop.Rproj} file (using the name you actually used) to start the session.

\hypertarget{add-some-folders}{%
\section{Add some folders}\label{add-some-folders}}

While file organization is a matter of personal preference, we ask that you use the directory structure shown here for your work in the workshop. Assuming we called our project \texttt{workshop}, the minimal directory structure has three folders in it plus the \texttt{.Rproj} file at the top level.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{\textbackslash{}workshop}
\NormalTok{    \textbackslash{}data}
\NormalTok{    \textbackslash{}results}
\NormalTok{    \textbackslash{}scripts}
\NormalTok{    workshop.Rproj}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

We use the folders as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{data} data files
\item
  \texttt{results} finished graphs and tabulated data formatted for display\\
\item
  \texttt{scripts} R scripts that operate on data to produce results
\end{itemize}

To create folders:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  use your usual method of creating new folders on your machine
\item
  or you can use the \emph{New Folder} button in the Files pane
\end{itemize}

For a video guide,

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \href{https://www.youtube.com/embed/kfcX5DEMAp4?start=290\&end=368}{Make some folders (04:50--06:08)} by R Ladies Sydney \citep{RLadiesSydney:2018:Lesson1}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{install-cran-packages}{%
\section{Install CRAN packages}\label{install-cran-packages}}

The fundamental unit of shareable code in R is the \emph{package.} For the R novice, an R package is like an ``app'' for R---a collection of functions, data, and documentation for doing work in R that is easily shared with others \citep{wickham2014advanced}.

Most packages are obtained from the \href{https://cran.r-project.org/}{CRAN} website \citep{cranweb}. To install a CRAN package using RStudio:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Launch RStudio
\end{itemize}

The RStudio interface has several panes. We want the \emph{Files/Plots/Packages} pane.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Select the \emph{Packages} tab
\end{itemize}

Next,

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Click \emph{Install} on the ribbon
\item
  In the dialog box, type the name of the package. For our first package, type \texttt{data.table} to install the data.table package \citep{R-data.table}
\item
  Check the \emph{Install dependencies} box
\item
  Click the \emph{Install} button
\end{itemize}

\begin{quote}
During the installation, Windows users might get a warning message about
Rtools, something like:

\texttt{WARNING:\ Rtools\ is\ required\ to\ build\ R\ packages\ but\ is\ not\ currently\ installed.\ Please\ download\ and\ install\ the\ appropriate\ version...}.
\end{quote}

Rtools is needed for packages with C/C++/Fortran code from source---which does not apply to us. You may ignore the warning and carry on.

In the RStudio Console, you should see a message like this one,

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{    package }\StringTok{\textquotesingle{}data.table\textquotesingle{}}\NormalTok{ successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

If successful, the package will appear in the Packages pane, e.g.,

Repeat the process for the following packages

\begin{verbatim}
wrapr 
Rdpack 
checkmate
\end{verbatim}

Alternatively, you can install them all at once by typing in the Console:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\# midfieldr depends on these packages}
\NormalTok{packages\_we\_need }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"data.table"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"wrapr"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"Rdpack"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"checkmate"}\NormalTok{)}
\FunctionTok{install.packages}\NormalTok{(packages\_we\_need)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{install-midfield-packages}{%
\section{Install MIDFIELD packages}\label{install-midfield-packages}}

\hypertarget{midfieldr}{%
\subsection{midfieldr}\label{midfieldr}}

midfieldr is not yet available from \href{https://cran.r-project.org/}{CRAN}. To install the development version of midfieldr from its \texttt{drat} repository, type in the Console:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\# type in the RStudio Console }
\FunctionTok{install.packages}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"midfieldr"}\NormalTok{, }
                 \AttributeTok{repos =} \StringTok{"https://MIDFIELDR.github.io/drat/"}\NormalTok{, }
                 \AttributeTok{type =} \StringTok{"source"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

You can confirm a successful installation by running the following lines to bring up the package help page in the Help window.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\# type in the RStudio Console }
\FunctionTok{library}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"midfieldr"}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{? }\StringTok{\textasciigrave{}}\AttributeTok{midfieldr{-}package}\StringTok{\textasciigrave{}}

\CommentTok{\# or, equivalently}
\FunctionTok{help}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"midfieldr{-}package"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

If the installation is successful, the code chunk above should produce a view of the help page as shown here.

\hypertarget{midfielddata}{%
\subsection{midfielddata}\label{midfielddata}}

Because of its size, the data package is stored in a \texttt{drat} repository instead of CRAN. Installation takes time; please be patient and wait for the Console prompt ``\textgreater{}'' to reappear.

Type (or copy and paste) the following lines in the RStudio Console.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\# type in the RStudio Console  }
\FunctionTok{install.packages}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"midfielddata"}\NormalTok{, }
                 \AttributeTok{repos =} \StringTok{"https://MIDFIELDR.github.io/drat/"}\NormalTok{, }
                 \AttributeTok{type =} \StringTok{"source"}\NormalTok{)}
\CommentTok{\# be patient}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Once the Console prompt ``\textgreater{}'' reappears, you can confirm a successful installation by viewing the package help page. In the Console, run:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\# type in the RStudio Console  }
\FunctionTok{library}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"midfielddata"}\NormalTok{)}
\FunctionTok{help}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"midfielddata{-}package"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

If the installation is successful, the code chunk above should produce a view of the help page as shown here.

R is an open source language and environment for statistical computing and graphics \citep{R-base}, ranked by IEEE in 2020 as the 6th most popular programming language (Python, Java, and C are the top three) \citep{Cass:2020}. If you are new to R, some of its best features, paraphrasing Wickham \citeyearpar{wickham2014advanced}, are:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  R is free, open source, and available on every major platform.
\item
  R packages provide effective tools for data analysis and visualization.
\item
  More than 17,750 open-source R packages are available (Jul 2021). Many are cutting-edge tools.
\end{itemize}

RStudio, an integrated development environment (IDE) for R, includes a console, editor, and tools for plotting, history, debugging, and workspace management as well as access to GitHub for collaboration and version control \citep{2016rstudio}.

At his point, the learning is self-directed. Choose the skills you want to continue working on. We have a set of tutorials for

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \protect\hyperlink{developing-r-skills}{Developing R skills}
\item
  \protect\hyperlink{continuing-the-case-study}{Continuing the case study}
\item
  \protect\hyperlink{exploring-midfieldr-functions}{Exploring midfieldr functions}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{developing-r-skills}{%
\subsection{Developing R skills}\label{developing-r-skills}}

The basic skills tutorials take about 50 minutes each.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \protect\hyperlink{r-basics}{R basics}
\item
  \protect\hyperlink{graph-basics}{Graph basics}\\

\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{continuing-the-case-study}{%
\subsection{Continuing the case study}\label{continuing-the-case-study}}

The case study is a quick tour of a typical workflow using student unit record data. This is a ``big picture'' development---functions are used without detailed explanations or development so that we can get to the results with as little distraction as possible. Anyone wanting more detail will find it in the detailed vignettes (links below in \protect\hyperlink{exploring-midfieldr-functions}{Exploring midfieldr functions}).

\begin{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{exploring-midfieldr-functions}{%
\subsection{Exploring midfieldr functions}\label{exploring-midfieldr-functions}}

Deep dive into the midfieldr functionality. The work flow follows the same general pattern as the quicker case study, but pauses to explore each function in more detail, exploring the arguments and strategies for use. In general, each tutorial is self-contained so you may enter at almost any point.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \href{https://midfieldr.github.io/midfieldr/articles/art-010-program-codes.html}{Program codes and names} Practice strategies of searching \texttt{cip} for programs we want to study.
\item
  \href{https://midfieldr.github.io/midfieldr/articles/art-015-subsetting-midfield-data.html}{Subsetting MIDFIELD data} Use programs codes to subset the MIDFIELD data tables.
\item
  \href{https://midfieldr.github.io/midfieldr/articles/art-020-data-sufficiency.html}{Data sufficiency} What it is and how it is applied to student unit-record (SUR) data.
\item
