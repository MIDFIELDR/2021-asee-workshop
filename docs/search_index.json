[["index.html", "Engaging with MIDFIELD Data 1 Introduction 1.1 Objectives 1.2 Description 1.3 Pre-workshop homework 1.4 Agenda 1.5 Facilitators 1.6 Licenses 1.7 Acknowledgement", " Engaging with MIDFIELD Data Susan Lord, Matthew Ohland, Marisa Orr, Richard Layton, and Russell Long 2021-07-26 1 Introduction 1.1 Objectives MIDFIELD contains individual Student Unit Record (SUR) data for 1.7M students at 33 US institutions (as of June 2021). MIDFIELD is large enough to permit grouping and summarizing by multiple characteristics, enabling researchers to examine student characteristics (race/ethnicity, sex, prior achievement) and curricular pathways (including coursework and major) by institution and over time. The goal of this workshop is to engage ASEE members with MIDFIELD data, in part using two R packages: midfieldr to provide tools for working with SURs and midfielddata to provide practice data. By the end of the workshop, participants should be able to: Describe key variables in MIDFIELD data tables Explore and tell a story from MIDFIELD data Begin using R, midfieldr, and midfielddata Explain key features of effective data displays 1.2 Description The robustness of the MIDFIELD data allows us to emphasize an intersectional approach to the study of student records, permitting multiple categories of inequity such as race/ethnicity and sex to be considered simultaneously. To introduce beginners to R, participants work through a self-paced tutorial covering basic elements of the R computing language and environment. To introduce midfieldr and using it to work with student record data, participants work through software tutorials that explore the SUR data and develop a persistence metric case study. For more experienced R users or anyone working at a faster pace, we offer a series of self-paced tutorials that introduce key features of midfieldr and how they are applied to compute persistence metrics and graph results. We also discuss the merits of the multiway graph design that is recommended for displaying results of this type. The agenda includes an interactive session to demonstrate contemporary principles of effective data display. 1.3 Pre-workshop homework To get the most out of the workshop, you should have the essential software installed and running several days before the workshop to give you time to contact us with questions if anything goes amiss. Install everything describes the homework. 1.4 Agenda Our three hours are organized approximately as shown.

This chapter describes all of the pre-workshop homework: Already installed? Install R and RStudio Create a project Add some folders Install CRAN packages Install MIDFIELD packages 2.1 Already installed? If you do not have R and RStudio installed, please skip this section and start with the next section. If you are already an R and RStudio user, this is a great time to check for updates. Updating RStudio RStudio menu Help &gt; Check for Updates will tell you if you are current or not. To update, close RStudio on your machine, download the new version from the RStudio website, and run the RStudio-some-version-number.exe. (Windows users might have to run the executable as an administrator.) Update your packages How to upgrade all out-of-date packages in What They Forgot to Teach You About R by Jennifer Bryan and Jim Hester. Updating R The easiest way to update R is to simply download the newest version. RStudio will automatically use the latest youve installed. Alternatively, Windows users can use the installr package: Install the installr package If open, close R and RStudio Navigate to your most recent Rgui.exe file located in your Programs directory, e.g., C:\\Program Files\\R\\R-4.0.0\\bin\\x64\\Rgui.exe Right-click on Rgui.exe and run as administrator In the R GUI window that appears, run the commands # Windows users only library(&quot;installr&quot;) updateR() Updating your R library How to transfer your library when updating R also by Bryan and Hester. Requires the fs package. Once your updates are complete Skip the next section and continue the homework with Create a project Add some folders Install CRAN packages Install MIDFIELD packages 2.2 Install R and RStudio The first steps are to install R and RStudio. Windows users may have to login as an Administrator before installing the software. Install R for your operating system Install RStudio, a user interface for R Once the installation is complete, you can take a 2-minute tour of the RStudio interface. Lets start (00:5702:32) by R Ladies Sydney [1] The same video includes a longer (7 minute) tour of the four quadrants (panes) in RStudio if you are interested. The RStudio quadrants (07:2114:40) by R Ladies Sydney [1] 2.3 Create a project To begin any project, we create an RStudio Project file and directory. You can recognize an R project file by its .Rproj suffix. If you prefer your instructions with commentary, Start with a Project (02:3404:50) by R Ladies Sydney [1] If you prefer basic written instructions, RStudio, File &gt; New Project &gt; New Directory &gt; New Project Or, click the New Project button in the Console ribbon, In the dialog box that appears, Type the workshop name as the directory name, for example, workshop, or if you like more detail, midfield-workshop-asee-2021 Use the browse button to select a location on your computer to create the project folder Click the Create Project button Whenever you work with the workshop materials, launch the workshop.Rproj file (using the name you actually used) to start the session. 2.4 Add some folders While file organization is a matter of personal preference, we ask that you use the directory structure shown here for your work in the workshop. Assuming we called our project workshop, the minimal directory structure has three folders in it plus the .Rproj file at the top level. \\workshop \\data \\results \\scripts workshop.Rproj We use the folders as follows: data data files results finished graphs and tabulated data formatted for display scripts R scripts that operate on data to produce results To create folders: use your usual method of creating new folders on your machine or you can use the New Folder button in the Files pane For a video guide, Make some folders (04:5006:08) by R Ladies Sydney [1] 2.5 Install CRAN packages The fundamental unit of shareable code in R is the package. For the R novice, an R package is like an app for Ra collection of functions, data, and documentation for doing work in R that is easily shared with others [2]. Most packages are obtained from the CRAN website [3]. To install a CRAN package using RStudio: Launch RStudio The RStudio interface has several panes. We want the Files/Plots/Packages pane. Select the Packages tab Next, Click Install on the ribbon In the dialog box, type the name of the package. For our first package, type data.table to install the data.table package [4] Check the Install dependencies box Click the Install button During the installation, Windows users might get a warning message about Rtools, something like: WARNING: Rtools is required to build R packages but is not currently installed. Please download and install the appropriate version.... Rtools is needed for packages with C/C++/FORTRAN code from sourcewhich does not apply to us. You may ignore the warning and carry on. In the RStudio Console, you should see a message like this one, package &#39;data.table&#39; successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked If successful, the package will appear in the Packages pane, e.g., Repeat the process for the following packages wrapr Rdpack checkmate Alternatively, you can install them all at once by typing in the Console: # midfieldr depends on these packages packages_we_need &lt;- c(&quot;data.table&quot;, &quot;wrapr&quot;, &quot;Rdpack&quot;, &quot;checkmate&quot;) install.packages(packages_we_need) 2.6 Install MIDFIELD packages 2.6.1 midfieldr midfieldr is not yet available from CRAN. To install the development version of midfieldr from its drat repository, type in the Console: # type in the RStudio Console install.packages(&quot;midfieldr&quot;, repos = &quot;https://MIDFIELDR.github.io/drat/&quot;, type = &quot;source&quot;) You can confirm a successful installation by running the following lines to bring up the package help page in the Help window. # type in the RStudio Console library(&quot;midfieldr&quot;) ? `midfieldr-package` # or, equivalently help(&quot;midfieldr-package&quot;) If the installation is successful, the code chunk above should produce a view of the help page as shown here. 2.6.2 midfielddata Because of its size, the data package is stored in a drat repository instead of CRAN. Installation takes time; please be patient and wait for the Console prompt &gt; to reappear. Type (or copy and paste) the following lines in the RStudio Console. # type in the RStudio Console install.packages(&quot;midfielddata&quot;, repos = &quot;https://MIDFIELDR.github.io/drat/&quot;, type = &quot;source&quot;) # be patient Once the Console prompt &gt; reappears, you can confirm a successful installation by viewing the package help page. In the Console, run: # type in the RStudio Console library(&quot;midfielddata&quot;) help(&quot;midfielddata-package&quot;) If the installation is successful, the code chunk above should produce a view of the help page as shown here.

If you are new to R, some of its best features, paraphrasing Wickham [2], are: R is free, open source, and available on every major platform. R packages provide effective tools for data analysis and visualization. More than 17,750 open-source R packages are available (Jul 2021). Many are cutting-edge tools. RStudio, an integrated development environment (IDE) for R, includes a console, editor, and tools for plotting, history, debugging, and workspace management as well as access to GitHub for collaboration and version control [7]. 5.1 Prerequisites Before proceeding, you should have completed Install everything Launched your workshop projectworkshop.Rproj or other name that you selectedto start the R session We suggest you start a new R script for each tutorial and save it to the scripts directory. For example, at the end of the workshop, your scripts directory might contain the following files: \\scripts \\01-R-basics.R \\02-getting-started.R \\03-case-study-programs.R \\04-case-study-students.R etc. 5.2 New to R? Prerequisites should be completed before proceeding. By the end of the workshop, our R beginners will have made progress on two or possibly three tutorials: R basics An introduction to R. Getting started: Examine the MIDFIELD practice data Case study programs Gather CIP codes and program names If there is still time remaining, continue to any tutorial listed in the After the workshop section. 5.3 Familiar with R? Prerequisites should be completed before proceeding. By the end of the workshop, our more experienced R users will have made substantive progress on two or possibly three tutorials: Getting started: Examine the MIDFIELD practice data Case study programs Gather CIP codes and program names Case study students Gather students who pass the data sufficiency criterion. If there is still time remaining, continue to any tutorial listed in the After the workshop section. 5.4 After the workshop At his point, the learning is self-directed. Choose the skills you want to continue working on. We have a set of tutorials for Developing R skills Continuing the case study Exploring midfieldr functions 5.4.1 Developing R skills The basic skills tutorials take about 50 minutes each. R basics Graph basics Data basics 5.4.2 Continuing the case study The case study is a quick tour of a typical workflow using student unit record data. This is a big picture developmentfunctions are used without detailed explanations or development so that we can get to the results with as little distraction as possible. Anyone wanting more detail will find it in the detailed vignettes (links in the next section). Case study programs Case study students Case study stickiness Case study graduation rate 5.4.3 Exploring midfieldr functions Deep dive into the midfieldr functionality. The work flow follows the same general pattern as the quicker case study, but pauses to explore each function in more detail, exploring the arguments and strategies for use. In general, each tutorial is self-contained so you may enter at almost any point. Program codes and names Practice strategies of searching cip for programs we want to study. Subsetting MIDFIELD data Use programs codes to subset the MIDFIELD data tables. Data sufficiency What it is and how it is applied to student unit-record (SUR) data. Timely completion What it is and how it is applied to SUR data. FYE programs What they are and how they are accommodated with SUR data. Multiway graphs How to graph and interpret a common data structure encountered when working with SUR data. Tabulating data How to tabulate multiway data for publication. 5.5 R basics This tutorial is an introduction to R adapted from [8] with extra material from [9]. If you already have R experience, you might still want to browse this section in case you find something new. Prerequisites should be completed before proceeding. After that, the tutorial should take no longer than 50 minutes. 5.5.1 Style guide A style guide is about making your script readablewhich is particularly useful when you ask someone to help you with your script. The following guidelines are adapted from McConnell [10] and Wickham [11]. Comments are annotations to make the source code easier for humans to understand but are ignored by R. Comments in R are denoted by a hash tag #. Spaces around operators. Usewhitespacetoenhancereadability. Place spaces around operators (=, +, -, &lt;-, etc.). Always put a space after a comma, but never before (just like in regular English). # good height &lt;- (feet * 12) + inches mean(x, na.rm = 10) # poor height&lt;-feet*12+inches mean(x,na.rm=10) The exception to the spaces around operators rule are those with high precedence such as exponentiation (^), sequence (:), or accessors ([[ or $). These operators are written without spaces, # good sqrt(x^2 + y^2) x &lt;- 1:10 df$z # poor sqrt(x ^ 2 + y ^ 2) x &lt;- 1 : 10 df $ z Adding extra spaces OK if it improves alignment of = or &lt;-. # good list( total_number = a + b + c, mean = (a + b + c) / n ) # also fine list( total_number = a + b + c, mean = (a + b + c) / n ) Comments. Avoid block comments that are hard to maintain, e.g., ####################################################################### ## class: GigaTron ## ## ## ## author: Dwight K. Coder ## ## date: July 4, 2014 ## ## ## ## Routines to control the twenty-first century&#39;s code evaluation ## ## tool. The entry point to these routines is the EvaluateCode() ## ## routine at the bottom of this file. ## ####################################################################### A version of this comment block that is easier to revise and maintain is, # GigaTron # Dwight K. Coder # 2014-07-04 # # EvaluateCode() is the entry point for our code evaluation routines Avoid writing comments that merely restate the code in English, e.g., # set x equal to 1 (poor comment) x &lt;- 1 Instead, write comments that describe the intent of a code paragraph. Such comments are particularly useful when someone other than the codes original author tries to modify the code. # swap the roots (good comment) oldRoot &lt;- root[0] root[0] &lt;- root[1] root[1] &lt;- oldRoot Comments should focus on why rather than how. # if establishing a new account (good comment) if (account_type == &quot;new_account&quot;) ... # if account flag is zero (poor comment) if (account_flag == 0) ... Use vertical white space. Group chunks of code into paragraphs separated by blank lines to reveal the structure of the program. # poor library(&quot;data.table&quot;); library(&quot;GDAdata&quot;) speed_ski &lt;- copy(SpeedSki) setDT(speed_ski) speed_ski &lt;- speed_ski[, .(Event, Sex, Speed)] setnames(speed_ski, old = c(&quot;Event&quot;, &quot;Sex&quot;, &quot;Speed&quot;), new = c(&quot;event&quot;, &quot;sex&quot;, &quot;speed&quot;)) # better library(&quot;data.table&quot;) library(&quot;GDAdata&quot;) # leave the original data unaltered before conversion to data.table speed_ski &lt;- copy(SpeedSki) setDT(speed_ski) # we need only three variables speed_ski &lt;- speed_ski[, .(Event, Sex, Speed)] # style guide prefers lowercase column names setnames(speed_ski, old = c(&quot;Event&quot;, &quot;Sex&quot;, &quot;Speed&quot;), new = c(&quot;event&quot;, &quot;sex&quot;, &quot;speed&quot;)) # RDS format preserves factors saveRDS(speed_ski, &quot;data/speed_ski.rds&quot;) 5.5.2 Open an R script Use File &gt; New File &gt; R Script to create a new R script Name the script 01-R-basics.R. By using a number at the start of the file name, the files stay in order in your directory. Save it in the scripts directory. (optional) Add a minimal header at the top of the script, e.g.: # R basics # 2021 ASEE Workshop: Engaging with MIDFIELD Data # Name # 2021-07-26 Use library() to load the packages we will use # Packages library(&quot;midfieldr&quot;) library(&quot;data.table&quot;) # Optional code to control data.table printing options( datatable.print.nrows = 10, datatable.print.topn = 5, datatable.print.class = TRUE ) Code chunks like the one above can be copied and pasted to your R script. 5.5.3 Everything in R has a name In R, every object has a name. named entities, like x or y data you have loaded, like my_data functions you use, like sin() Some names are forbidden reserved words, like TRUE or FALSE programming words, like Inf, for, else, and function special entities, like NA and NaN Some names should not be used because they name commonly used functions q() quit c() combine or concatenate mean() range() var() variance Names in R are case-sensitive my_data and My_Data are different objects We use the style of naming things in lower case with words separated by underscores (no spaces), e.g., speed_ski. The camel-case is also popular, e.g., SpeedSki or speedSki. The choice is yours. If you want to know if a name has already been used in a package you have loaded, go to the RStudio console, type a question mark followed by the name, e.g., # type in the Console `? c()` `? mean()` If the name is in use, a help page appears in the RStudio Help pane. 5.5.4 Everything in R is an object Origins of R objects Some objects are built in to R Some objects are loaded with packages Some objects are created by you Type this line of code in your script, Save. c() is the function to combine or concatenate its elements to create a vector. # type in the R script c(1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 25) Options for running a script: Select a line (or lines) and ctrl Enter (Mac OS cmd Return) To run from the beginning to a line ctrl alt B (Mac OS cmd option B) Run the script and your Console should show [1] 1 2 3 1 3 25. In these notes, when we show results printed in your Console, we preface the printout with #&gt; (which does not appear on your screen) to distinguish the results from the script. For example, we show the line from above and its output like this: c(1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 25) # &lt;- typed in the script #&gt; [1] 1 2 3 1 3 25 # &lt;- appears in the Console The [1] that leads the output line is a label identifying the index of the element that starts that line. More on that in a little while. You create objects my assigning them names. &lt;- is the assignment operator, keyboard shortcut: alt\\(-\\) (Mac OS option\\(-\\)) # Practice assigning an object to a name x &lt;- c(1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 25) y &lt;- c(5, 31, 71, 1, 3, 21, 6) To see the result in the Console, type the object name in the script, Save, and run. (Remember, type the line of code but not the line prefaced by #&gt;thats the output line so you can check your results.) # type in the R script or in the Console x #&gt; [1] 1 2 3 1 3 25 y #&gt; [1] 5 31 71 1 3 21 6 Objects exist in your R project workspace, listed in the RStudio Environment pane Data are also named objects.

The resulting integer is the number of NA values in the vector. # determine the unique values in a column sort(unique(toy_student[, sex])) #&gt; [1] &quot;Female&quot; &quot;Male&quot; # are any of the values NA? is.na(toy_student[, sex]) #&gt; [1] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE #&gt; [13] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE #&gt; [25] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE #&gt; [37] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE #&gt; [49] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE #&gt; [61] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE #&gt; [73] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE #&gt; [85] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE #&gt; [97] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE # How many values are NA? sum(is.na(toy_student[, sex])) #&gt; [1] 0 Repeat for other columns. sort(unique(toy_student[, institution])) #&gt; [1] &quot;Institution A&quot; &quot;Institution B&quot; &quot;Institution C&quot; &quot;Institution D&quot; #&gt; [5] &quot;Institution E&quot; &quot;Institution F&quot; &quot;Institution G&quot; &quot;Institution H&quot; #&gt; [9] &quot;Institution J&quot; &quot;Institution K&quot; &quot;Institution L&quot; &quot;Institution M&quot; sum(is.na(toy_student[, institution])) #&gt; [1] 0 sort(unique(toy_student[, race])) #&gt; [1] &quot;Asian&quot; &quot;Black&quot; &quot;Hispanic/Latinx&quot; &quot;International&quot; #&gt; [5] &quot;Native American&quot; &quot;Other/Unknown&quot; &quot;White&quot; sum(is.na(toy_student[, race])) #&gt; [1] 0 sort(unique(toy_student[, hours_transfer])) #&gt; [1] 1 2 3 4 5 7 24 30 55 80 sum(is.na(toy_student[, hours_transfer])) #&gt; [1] 88 The help pages for functions are accessed via the Console. By viewing the help page you can find descriptions of arguments and their default settings if any. Try a few: ? mean() ? sd() ? summary() ? names() ? head() ? sort() ? unique() ? is.na() ? sum() 5.5.6 R functions come in packages Functions are bundled in packages Families of useful functions are bundled into packages that you can install, load, and use Packages allow you to build on the work of others You can write your own functions and packages too A lot of the work in data science consists of choosing the right functions and giving them the right arguments to get our data into the form we need for analysis or visualization For example, to see the list of functions in the midfieldr package, sort(getNamespaceExports(&quot;midfieldr&quot;)) #&gt; [1] &quot;add_completion_timely&quot; &quot;add_data_sufficiency&quot; &quot;add_institution&quot; #&gt; [4] &quot;add_race_sex&quot; &quot;add_timely_term&quot; &quot;condition_fye&quot; #&gt; [7] &quot;condition_multiway&quot; &quot;filter_match&quot; &quot;filter_search&quot; To view a help page, type, e.g., # type in the Console ? add_race_sex() In contrast, do the same for the data.table package, sort(getNamespaceExports(&quot;data.table&quot;)) #&gt; [1] &quot;%between%&quot; &quot;%chin%&quot; &quot;%flike%&quot; #&gt; [4] &quot;%ilike%&quot; &quot;%inrange%&quot; &quot;%like%&quot; #&gt; [7] &quot;.__C__data.table&quot; &quot;.__C__IDate&quot; &quot;.__C__ITime&quot; #&gt; [10] &quot;.__T__$:base&quot; &quot;.__T__$&lt;-:base&quot; &quot;.__T__[:base&quot; #&gt; [13] &quot;.__T__[[&lt;-:base&quot; &quot;.__T__[&lt;-:base&quot; &quot;.BY&quot; #&gt; [16] &quot;.EACHI&quot; &quot;.GRP&quot; &quot;.I&quot; #&gt; [19] &quot;.Last.updated&quot; &quot;.N&quot; &quot;.NGRP&quot; #&gt; [22] &quot;.rbind.data.table&quot; &quot;.SD&quot; &quot;:=&quot; #&gt; [25] &quot;address&quot; &quot;alloc.col&quot; &quot;as.data.table&quot; #&gt; [28] &quot;as.IDate&quot; &quot;as.ITime&quot; &quot;as.xts.data.table&quot; #&gt; [31] &quot;between&quot; &quot;chgroup&quot; &quot;chmatch&quot; #&gt; [34] &quot;chorder&quot; &quot;CJ&quot; &quot;copy&quot; #&gt; [37] &quot;cube&quot; &quot;data.table&quot; &quot;dcast&quot; #&gt; [40] &quot;dcast.data.table&quot; &quot;fcase&quot; &quot;fcoalesce&quot; #&gt; [43] &quot;fifelse&quot; &quot;fintersect&quot; &quot;first&quot; #&gt; ... etc. truncated Dont panic! We will use only a small number of these functions from data.table. For example, the %ilike% function, view its help page by running # type in the Console ? `%ilike%` 5.5.7 R objects have class Everything is an object and every object has a class. class(x) #&gt; [1] &quot;numeric&quot; class(summary) #&gt; [1] &quot;function&quot; Certain actions will change the class of an object. Suppose we try create a vector from the x object and a text string, new_vector &lt;- c(x, &quot;Apple&quot;) new_vector #&gt; [1] &quot;1&quot; &quot;2&quot; &quot;3&quot; &quot;1&quot; &quot;3&quot; &quot;25&quot; &quot;Apple&quot; class(new_vector) #&gt; [1] &quot;character&quot; By adding the word Apple to the vector, R changed the class from numeric to character. All the numbers are enclosed in quotes: they are now character strings and cannot be used in calculations. The most common class of data object we will use is the data frame. The data in midfieldr are stored as data frames, e.g., # examine another midfieldr data set study_stickiness #&gt; program race sex ever grad stick #&gt; &lt;char&gt; &lt;char&gt; &lt;char&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;num&gt; #&gt; 1: Civil Asian Female 17 12 70.6 #&gt; 2: Civil Black Female 54 28 51.9 #&gt; 3: Civil White Female 329 232 70.5 #&gt; 4: Civil Asian Male 37 24 64.9 #&gt; 5: Civil Black Male 98 43 43.9 #&gt; --- #&gt; 34: Mechanical Hispanic/Latinx Male 76 47 61.8 #&gt; 35: Mechanical International Male 37 19 51.4 #&gt; 36: Mechanical Native American Male 14 8 57.1 #&gt; 37: Mechanical Other/Unknown Male 48 28 58.3 #&gt; 38: Mechanical White Male 1940 1265 65.2 class(study_stickiness) #&gt; [1] &quot;data.table&quot; &quot;data.frame&quot; Six columns: program, race, sex, ever, grad, stick. Three columns are labeled &lt;char&gt; for character, categorical variables Two columns are labeled &lt;int&gt; for integer One column is labeled &lt;num&gt; for double precision The additional class shown data.table is an augmented version of the base R data.frame class. When working with these objects you can use base R data.frame syntax or data.table syntax. If you have a data.frame object that is not a data.table, e.g. the airquality data frame that comes with R class(airquality) #&gt; [1] &quot;data.frame&quot; head(airquality) #&gt; Ozone Solar.R Wind Temp Month Day #&gt; 1 41 190 7.4 67 5 1 #&gt; 2 36 118 8.0 72 5 2 #&gt; 3 12 149 12.6 74 5 3 #&gt; 4 18 313 11.5 62 5 4 #&gt; 5 NA NA 14.3 56 5 5 #&gt; 6 28 NA 14.9 66 5 6 You can convert it to data.table object with as.data.table() and assign it to a _slightly) different name. air_quality &lt;- as.data.table(airquality) class(air_quality) #&gt; [1] &quot;data.table&quot; &quot;data.frame&quot; air_quality #&gt; Ozone Solar.R Wind Temp Month Day #&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;num&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; #&gt; 1: 41 190 7.4 67 5 1 #&gt; 2: 36 118 8.0 72 5 2 #&gt; 3: 12 149 12.6 74 5 3 #&gt; 4: 18 313 11.5 62 5 4 #&gt; 5: NA NA 14.3 56 5 5 #&gt; --- #&gt; 149: 30 193 6.9 70 9 26 #&gt; 150: NA 145 13.2 77 9 27 #&gt; 151: 14 191 14.3 75 9 28 #&gt; 152: 18 131 8.0 76 9 29 #&gt; 153: 20 223 11.5 68 9 30 The data frame as a whole has a class; so do the individual columns. class(air_quality[, Ozone]) #&gt; [1] &quot;integer&quot; class(air_quality) #&gt; [1] &quot;data.table&quot; &quot;data.frame&quot; 5.5.8 R objects have structure To see inside an object ask for its structure using the str() function. str(x) #&gt; num [1:6] 1 2 3 1 3 25 str(toy_term) #&gt; Classes &#39;data.table&#39; and &#39;data.frame&#39;: 169 obs. of 6 variables: #&gt; $ mcid : chr &quot;MID25899243&quot; &quot;MID26319252&quot; &quot;MID25841465&quot; &quot;MID26560837&quot; ... #&gt; $ institution: chr &quot;Institution B&quot; &quot;Institution E&quot; &quot;Institution M&quot; &quot;Institution J&quot; ... #&gt; $ term : chr &quot;19943&quot; &quot;20021&quot; &quot;20023&quot; &quot;19981&quot; ... #&gt; $ cip6 : chr &quot;240102&quot; &quot;140801&quot; &quot;260101&quot; &quot;999999&quot; ... #&gt; $ level : chr &quot;03 Junior&quot; &quot;04 Senior&quot; &quot;02 Sophomore&quot; &quot;02 Sophomore&quot; ... #&gt; $ hours_term : num 5 5 16 12 15 21 9 12 17 17 ... #&gt; - attr(*, &quot;.internal.selfref&quot;)=&lt;externalptr&gt; str(airquality) #&gt; &#39;data.frame&#39;: 153 obs. of 6 variables: #&gt; $ Ozone : int 41 36 12 18 NA 28 23 19 8 NA ... #&gt; $ Solar.R: int 190 118 149 313 NA NA 299 99 19 194 ... #&gt; $ Wind : num 7.4 8 12.6 11.5 14.3 14.9 8.6 13.8 20.1 8.6 ... #&gt; $ Temp : int 67 72 74 62 56 66 65 59 61 69 ... #&gt; $ Month : int 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 ... #&gt; $ Day : int 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ... str(air_quality) #&gt; Classes &#39;data.table&#39; and &#39;data.frame&#39;: 153 obs. of 6 variables: #&gt; $ Ozone : int 41 36 12 18 NA 28 23 19 8 NA ... #&gt; $ Solar.R: int 190 118 149 313 NA NA 299 99 19 194 ... #&gt; $ Wind : num 7.4 8 12.6 11.5 14.3 14.9 8.6 13.8 20.1 8.6 ... #&gt; $ Temp : int 67 72 74 62 56 66 65 59 61 69 ... #&gt; $ Month : int 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 ... #&gt; $ Day : int 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ... #&gt; - attr(*, &quot;.internal.selfref&quot;)=&lt;externalptr&gt; 5.5.9 R only does what you tell it Healy [12] offers this advice for specific things to watch out for: Make sure parentheses are balancedthat every opening ( has a corresponding closing ). Make sure you complete your expressions. If you see a + in the Console instead of the usual prompt &gt;, that means that R thinks you havent written a complete expression. You can hit Esc or Ctrl C to force your way back to the Console and try correcting the code. Expect to make errors and dont worry when that happens. You wont break anything. As you work through the MIDFIELD tutorials, well introduce syntax by example from both base R and the data.table package. There can be subtle differences that we will attempt to avoid by consistent usage. For example, to subset a column from a data frame but keep it as a column (not a vector), the base R syntax is # base R subset one column airquality[, &quot;Ozone&quot;, drop = FALSE] #&gt; Ozone #&gt; 1 41 #&gt; 2 36 #&gt; 3 12 #&gt; 4 18 #&gt; 5 NA #&gt; 6 28 #&gt; 7 23 #&gt; 8 19 #&gt; 9 8 #&gt; 10 NA #&gt; ..., etc., truncated for brevity In data.table syntax, the same operation is as follows. Note we created a new object air_quality that is a data.table form of the original data frame. # data.table extract one column air_quality[, .(Ozone)] #&gt; Ozone #&gt; &lt;int&gt; #&gt; 1: 41 #&gt; 2: 36 #&gt; 3: 12 #&gt; 4: 18 #&gt; 5: NA #&gt; --- #&gt; 149: 30 #&gt; 150: NA #&gt; 151: 14 #&gt; 152: 18 #&gt; 153: 20 If we want the same information extracted as a vector, we would: # base R subset one column as a vector airquality[, &quot;Ozone&quot;] #&gt; [1] 41 36 12 18 NA 28 23 19 8 NA 7 16 11 14 18 14 34 6 #&gt; [19] 30 11 1 11 4 32 NA NA NA 23 45 115 37 NA NA NA NA NA #&gt; [37] NA 29 NA 71 39 NA NA 23 NA NA 21 37 20 12 13 NA NA NA #&gt; [55] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA 135 49 32 NA 64 40 77 97 97 85 NA #&gt; [73] 10 27 NA 7 48 35 61 79 63 16 NA NA 80 108 20 52 82 50 #&gt; [91] 64 59 39 9 16 78 35 66 122 89 110 NA NA 44 28 65 NA 22 #&gt; [109] 59 23 31 44 21 9 NA 45 168 73 NA 76 118 84 85 96 78 73 #&gt; [127] 91 47 32 20 23 21 24 44 21 28 9 13 46 18 13 24 16 13 #&gt; [145] 23 36 7 14 30 NA 14 18 20 # data.table subset one column as a vector air_quality[, Ozone] #&gt; [1] 41 36 12 18 NA 28 23 19 8 NA 7 16 11 14 18 14 34 6 #&gt; [19] 30 11 1 11 4 32 NA NA NA 23 45 115 37 NA NA NA NA NA #&gt; [37] NA 29 NA 71 39 NA NA 23 NA NA 21 37 20 12 13 NA NA NA #&gt; [55] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA 135 49 32 NA 64 40 77 97 97 85 NA #&gt; [73] 10 27 NA 7 48 35 61 79 63 16 NA NA 80 108 20 52 82 50 #&gt; [91] 64 59 39 9 16 78 35 66 122 89 110 NA NA 44 28 65 NA 22 #&gt; [109] 59 23 31 44 21 9 NA 45 168 73 NA 76 118 84 85 96 78 73 #&gt; [127] 91 47 32 20 23 21 24 44 21 28 9 13 46 18 13 24 16 13 #&gt; [145] 23 36 7 14 30 NA 14 18 20 In each case, you will note that the square bracket operators include a comma [i, j]. In general, the comma separates row operations i from column operations j. When there is no row operation (as in the examples above), the i position is empty. In data table syntax, we go one step further and add a grouping index, that is DT[i, j, by] This can be read as Take DT, subset/reorder rows using i, then calculate j, grouped by by. You dont have to go into it any more deeply than this for nowwe will illustrate it by example in the midfieldr tutorials. 5.5.10 To get help Package main help For a packages main help page, help(package = \"name_of_package\"), to obtain a list of all the functions (and possibly some data objects) in the package. # type in the Console help(package = &quot;midfieldr&quot;) In the Help pane, click through any of the links for details on the function. Package vignettes Some packages come with vignettes, articles explaining how to use the package for specific tasks. For example, # type in the Console browseVignettes(package = &quot;data.table&quot;) browseVignettes(package = &quot;ggplot2&quot;) # to see a listing of all vignettes in all your installed packages browseVignettes() Function help A number of times so far weve shown how to get the help page for a function when we know its name, e.g., # type in the Console ? str() If you recall only a part of the function name, use apropos() to search packages that are currently loaded. Loading a package is what we do when we use the library() function at the top of a script. For example, midfieldr has functions with timely in their name because they involve timely completion. apropos() reports two functions: # type in the Console apropos(&quot;timely&quot;) #&gt; [1] &quot;add_completion_timely&quot; &quot;add_timely_term&quot; Examples There are often examples at the end of an R function help page. You can run them using the example() function. For example, # base R function examples example(&quot;mean&quot;) #&gt; #&gt; mean&gt; x &lt;- c(0:10, 50) #&gt; #&gt; mean&gt; xm &lt;- mean(x) #&gt; #&gt; mean&gt; c(xm, mean(x, trim = 0.10)) #&gt; [1] 8.75 5.50 try one of the midfieldr function examples, # midfieldr function examples example(&quot;add_institution&quot;) #&gt; #&gt; add_ns&gt; # Extract a column of IDs from student #&gt; add_ns&gt; id &lt;- toy_student[, .(mcid)] #&gt; #&gt; add_ns&gt; # Add institutions from term #&gt; add_ns&gt; DT1 &lt;- add_institution(id, midfield_term = toy_term) #&gt; #&gt; add_ns&gt; head(DT1) #&gt; mcid institution #&gt; &lt;char&gt; &lt;char&gt; #&gt; 1: MID25783939 Institution M #&gt; 2: MID25784402 Institution M #&gt; 3: MID25805538 Institution M #&gt; 4: MID25808099 Institution M #&gt; 5: MID25816437 Institution M #&gt; 6: MID25826223 Institution M #&gt; #&gt; add_ns&gt; nrow(DT1) #&gt; [1] 100 #&gt; #&gt; add_ns&gt; # Will overwrite institution column if present #&gt; add_ns&gt; DT2 &lt;- add_institution(DT1, midfield_term = toy_term) #&gt; #&gt; add_ns&gt; head(DT2) #&gt; mcid institution #&gt; &lt;char&gt; &lt;char&gt; #&gt; 1: MID25783939 Institution M #&gt; 2: MID25784402 Institution M #&gt; 3: MID25805538 Institution M #&gt; 4: MID25808099 Institution M #&gt; 5: MID25816437 Institution M #&gt; 6: MID25826223 Institution M #&gt; #&gt; add_ns&gt; nrow(DT2) #&gt; [1] 100 Online resources Tutorial Getting Started in R: Tinyverse Edition.
