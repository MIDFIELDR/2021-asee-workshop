If you are new to R, some of its best features, paraphrasing Wickham [3], are: R is free, open source, and available on every major platform. R packages provide effective tools for data analysis and visualization. More than 17,750 open-source R packages are available (Jun 2021). Many are cutting-edge tools. RStudio, an integrated development environment (IDE) for R, includes a console, editor, and tools for plotting, history, debugging, and workspace management as well as access to GitHub for collaboration and version control [4]. 6.1 Prerequisites Before proceeding, you should have completed Install everything Set up a project Launched your workshop projectworkshop.Rproj or other name that you selectedto start the R session We suggest you start a new R script for each tutorial and save it to the scripts directory. For example, at the end of the workshop, your scripts directory might contain the following files: \\scripts \\R-basics.R \\getting-started.R \\case-study-programs.R \\case-study-students.R etc. 6.2 New to R? Prerequisites should be completed before proceeding. By the end of the workshop, our R beginners will have made progress on two or possibly three tutorials: R basics An introduction to R, generally less than an hour. Getting started: An introduction to the MIDFIELD practice data tables. Case study programs Construct a data frame of program CIP codes and program names for four engineering programs (Civil, Electrical, Industrial, and Mechanical) If you complete these tutorials and there is still time remaining, please consider moving on the to tutorials listed in the After the workshop section. 6.3 Familiar with R? Prerequisites should be completed before proceeding. By the end of the workshop, our more experienced R users will have made substantive progress on two or possibly three tutorials: Getting started: An introduction to the MIDFIELD practice data tables Case study programs Construct a data frame of program CIP codes and program names for four engineering programs (Civil, Electrical, Industrial, and Mechanical) Case study students Develop a data frame of the case study students who pass the data sufficiency criterion. If you complete these tutorials and there is still time remaining, please consider moving on the to tutorials listed in the After the workshop section. 6.4 After the workshop At his point, the learning is self-directed. Choose the skills you want to continue working on. We have a set of tutorials for Developing R skills Continuing the case study Exploring midfieldr functions 6.4.1 Developing R skills The basic skills tutorials take about 50 minutes each. R basics Graph basics Data basics 6.4.2 Continuing the case study The case study is a quick tour of a typical workflow using student unit record data. This is a big picture developmentfunctions are used without detailed explanations or development so that we can get to the results with as little distraction as possible. Anyone wanting more detail will find it in the detailed vignettes (links below in Exploring midfieldr functions). Case study programs Case study students Case study stickiness Case study graduation rate 6.4.3 Exploring midfieldr functions Deep dive into the midfieldr functionality. The work flow follows the same general pattern as the quicker case study, but pauses to explore each function in more detail, exploring the arguments and strategies for use. In general, each tutorial is self-contained so you may enter at almost any point. Program codes and names Practice strategies of searching cip for programs we want to study. Subsetting MIDFIELD data Use programs codes to subset the MIDFIELD data tables. Data sufficiency What it is and how it is applied to student unit-record (SUR) data. Timely completion What it is and how it is applied to SUR data. FYE programs What they are and how they are accommodated with SUR data. Multiway graphs How to graph and interpret a common data structure encountered when working with SUR data. Tabulating data How to tabulate multiway data for publication. 6.5 R basics text 6.5.1 Style guide 6.5.2 Everything in R has a name 6.5.3 Everything in R is an object 6.5.4 Use functions to do things 6.5.5 R functions come in packages 6.5.6 R objects have class 6.5.7 R objects have structure 6.5.8 R only does what you tell it 6.5.9 Keyboard shortcuts 6.5.10 Whats next? 6.6 Graph basics 6.7 Data basics  top of page "]]
