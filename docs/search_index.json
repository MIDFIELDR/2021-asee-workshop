MIDFIELD contains student record data from 19882017 for approximately one million undergraduate, degree-seeking students at the partner institutions. The goal of this workshop is to make MIDFIELD more accessible to the ASEE community. The workshop introduces midfieldr (a package in the R software environment) that provides access to a MIDFIELD student-record data sample and tools to analyze and graph persistence metrics such as graduation rates. The workshop is designed for R beginners. By the end of the workshop, participants should be able to: Describe key variables in MIDFIELD data tables Explore and tell a story from MIDFIELD data Use midfieldr, an R package specifically designed for use with MIDFIELD Explain key features of effective data displays 1.2 Description The robustness of the MIDFIELD data allows us to emphasize an intersectional approach to the study of student records, permitting multiple categories of inequity such as race/ethnicity and sex to be considered simultaneously. To introduce beginners to R, participants work through a self-paced tutorial covering basic elements of the R computing language and environment. To introduce midfieldr and using it to work with student record data, participants work through a Get started tutorial in which they determine the numbers of students ever enrolled in two programs, group and summarize the data, and graph the results. For more experienced R users or anyone working at a faster pace, we offer a series of self-paced tutorials that introduce key features of midfieldr and how they are applied to compute persistence metrics and graph results. We also discuss the merits of the multiway graph design that is recommended for displaying results of this type. The agenda includes an interactive session to demonstrate contemporary principles of effective data display. 1.3 Pre-workshop homework To get the most out of the workshop, you should have the essential software installed and running several days before the workshop to give you time to contact us with questions if anything goes amiss. Your homework is explained on the pages: Install everything [Setup a project] 1.4 Agenda Our three hours are organized approximately as shown.

Your pre-workshop homework: 2.1 Install R and RStudio 2.2 Install packages we need 2.3 Install midfielddata 2.4 Install midfieldr 3.1 Create a project 3.2 Add some folders If you already have R and RStudio installed, this is a great time to Make sure your R installation is current Make sure your RStudio installation is current Update your packages by running: update.packages(ask = FALSE, checkBuilt = TRUE) 2.1 Install R and RStudio The first steps are to install R and RStudio. Windows users may have to login as an Administrator before installing the software. Install R for your operating system Install RStudio, a user interface for R Once the installation is complete, you can take a 2-minute tour of the RStudio interface. Lets start (00:5702:32) by R Ladies Sydney [1] The same video includes a longer (7 minute) tour of the four quadrants (panes) in RStudio if you are interested. The RStudio quadrants (07:2114:40) by R Ladies Sydney [1] 2.2 Create a project To begin any project, we create an RStudio Project file and directory. You can recognize an R project file by its .Rproj suffix. If you prefer your instructions with commentary, Start with a Project (02:3404:50) by R Ladies Sydney [1] If you prefer basic written instructions, RStudio, File &gt; New Project &gt; New Directory &gt; New Project Or, click the New Project button in the Console ribbon, In the dialog box that appears, Type the workshop name as the directory name, for example, workshop, or if you like more detail, midfield-workshop-asee-2021 Use the browse button to select a location on your computer to create the project folder Click the Create Project button Whenever you work with the workshop materials, launch the workshop.Rproj file (using the name you actually used) to start the session. 2.3 Add some folders While file organization is a matter of personal preference, we ask that you use the directory structure shown here for your work in the workshop. Assuming we called our project workshop, the minimal directory structure has three folders in it plus the .Rproj file at the top level. \\workshop \\data \\results \\scripts workshop.Rproj We use the folders as follows: data data files results finished graphs and tabulated data formatted for display scripts R scripts that operate on data to produce results If you prefer your instructions with commentary, Make some folders (04:5006:08) by R Ladies Sydney [1] If you prefer basic written instructions, use your usual method of creating new folders on your machine or you can use the New Folder button in the Files pane 2.4 Create a library for packages Packages are like apps for R. As Hadley Wickham states, Packages are the fundamental units of reproducible R code. They include reusable functions, the documentation that describes how to use them, and sample data. If we store packages in a library separate from the base R installation, then when you update R, you dont have to reinstall every package, saving a lot of time. If you happen to be working with R on a network, storing your library locally can save you time tracking down obscure problems that R has with network drives as well. At the top level of your drive, create a new directory (folder) named R. In that directory create a new folder named library, for example, Windows: C:/R/library Mac OS and Linux: ~/R/library 2.5 Create the .Renviron file The .Renviron file is a text file that directs R packages to be installed in the R/library directory created earlier. To create the file, with RStudio open, Create a new text file, File menu &gt; New File &gt; Text File. Save the file to the workshop main directory using the filename .Renviron In this file, write the following line of text that tells R the path to the stand-alone package library you created earlier. Windows: R_LIBS_USER=\"C:/R/library\" Mac OS and Linux: R_LIBS_USER=\"~/R/library\" Save and close to recognize the .Renviron file. Save and close the .Renviron file. Close RStudio Lets check your project directory. You should have at least the following folders and files, \\workshop \\data \\results \\scripts .Renviron workshop.Rproj Remember, every time you create a new project, paste a copy of the .Renviron file at the top level of the project directory. 2.6 Install packages we need The fundamental unit of shareable code in R is the package. For the R novice, an R package is like an app for Ra collection of functions, data, and documentation for doing work in R that is easily shared with others [2]. Most packages are obtained from the CRAN website [3]. To install a CRAN package using RStudio: Launch RStudio The RStudio interface has several panes. We want the Files/Plots/Packages pane. Select the Packages tab Next, Click Install on the ribbon In the dialog box, type the name of the package. For our first package, type data.table to install the data.table package [4] Check the Install dependencies box Click the Install button In the RStudio Console, you should see a message like this one, package &#39;data.table&#39; successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked If successful, the package will appear in the Packages pane, e.g., Repeat the process for the following packages wrapr Rdpack checkmate Alternatively, you can install them all at once by typing in the Console: # midfieldr depends on these packages packages_we_need &lt;- c(&quot;data.table&quot;, &quot;wrapr&quot;, &quot;Rdpack&quot;, &quot;checkmate&quot;) install.packages(packages_we_need) 2.7 Install midfieldr During the installation, Windows users might get a warning message about Rtools, something like the following. You may ignore the warning and carry on. WARNING: Rtools is required to build R packages but is not currently installed. Please download and install the appropriate version... midfieldr is not yet available from CRAN. To install the development version of midfieldr from its drat repository, type in the Console: # install midfieldr from drat repo install.packages(&quot;midfieldr&quot;, repos = &quot;https://MIDFIELDR.github.io/drat/&quot;, type = &quot;source&quot;) You can confirm a successful installation by running the following lines to bring up the package help page in the Help window. library(&quot;midfieldr&quot;) help(&quot;midfieldr-package&quot;) If the installation is successful, the code chunk above should produce a view of the help page as shown here. 2.8 Install midfielddata Because of its size, the data package is stored in a drat repository instead of CRAN. Installation takes time; please be patient and wait for the Console prompt &gt; to reappear. Type (or copy and paste) the following lines in the RStudio Console. # type in the RStudio Console install.packages(&quot;midfielddata&quot;, repos = &quot;https://MIDFIELDR.github.io/drat/&quot;, type = &quot;source&quot;) # be patient Once the Console prompt &gt; reappears, you can confirm a successful installation by viewing the package help page. In the Console, run: # type in the RStudio Console library(&quot;midfielddata&quot;) help(&quot;midfielddata-package&quot;) If the installation is successful, the code chunk above should produce a view of the help page as shown here. If this step is successful, please continue your homework by completing: 3.1 Create a project 3.2 Add some folders  top of page "],["setup-project.html", "3 Set up a project 3.1 Create a project 3.2 Add some folders", " 3 Set up a project To begin any project, we create an RStudio Project file and directory.

If you are new to R, some of its best features, paraphrasing Wickham [2], are: R is free, open source, and available on every major platform. R packages provide effective tools for data analysis and visualization. More than 17,750 open-source R packages are available (Jun 2021). Many are cutting-edge tools. RStudio, an integrated development environment (IDE) for R, includes a console, editor, and tools for plotting, history, debugging, and workspace management as well as access to GitHub for collaboration and version control [7]. 6.1 Prerequisites Before proceeding, you should have completed Install everything Set up a project Launched your workshop projectworkshop.Rproj or other name that you selectedto start the R session We suggest you start a new R script for each tutorial and save it to the scripts directory. For example, at the end of the workshop, your scripts directory might contain the following files: \\scripts \\R-basics.R \\getting-started.R \\case-study-programs.R \\case-study-students.R etc. 6.2 New to R? Prerequisites should be completed before proceeding. By the end of the workshop, our R beginners will have made progress on two or possibly three tutorials: R basics An introduction to R, generally less than an hour. Getting started: An introduction to the MIDFIELD practice data tables. Case study programs Construct a data frame of program CIP codes and program names for four engineering programs (Civil, Electrical, Industrial, and Mechanical) If you complete these tutorials and there is still time remaining, please consider moving on the to tutorials listed in the After the workshop section. 6.3 Familiar with R? Prerequisites should be completed before proceeding. By the end of the workshop, our more experienced R users will have made substantive progress on two or possibly three tutorials: Getting started: An introduction to the MIDFIELD practice data tables Case study programs Construct a data frame of program CIP codes and program names for four engineering programs (Civil, Electrical, Industrial, and Mechanical) Case study students Develop a data frame of the case study students who pass the data sufficiency criterion. If you complete these tutorials and there is still time remaining, please consider moving on the to tutorials listed in the After the workshop section. 6.4 After the workshop At his point, the learning is self-directed. Choose the skills you want to continue working on. We have a set of tutorials for Developing R skills Continuing the case study Exploring midfieldr functions 6.4.1 Developing R skills The basic skills tutorials take about 50 minutes each. R basics Graph basics Data basics 6.4.2 Continuing the case study The case study is a quick tour of a typical workflow using student unit record data. This is a big picture developmentfunctions are used without detailed explanations or development so that we can get to the results with as little distraction as possible. Anyone wanting more detail will find it in the detailed vignettes (links below in Exploring midfieldr functions). Case study programs Case study students Case study stickiness Case study graduation rate 6.4.3 Exploring midfieldr functions Deep dive into the midfieldr functionality. The work flow follows the same general pattern as the quicker case study, but pauses to explore each function in more detail, exploring the arguments and strategies for use. In general, each tutorial is self-contained so you may enter at almost any point. Program codes and names Practice strategies of searching cip for programs we want to study. Subsetting MIDFIELD data Use programs codes to subset the MIDFIELD data tables. Data sufficiency What it is and how it is applied to student unit-record (SUR) data. Timely completion What it is and how it is applied to SUR data. FYE programs What they are and how they are accommodated with SUR data. Multiway graphs How to graph and interpret a common data structure encountered when working with SUR data. Tabulating data How to tabulate multiway data for publication. 6.5 R basics This tutorial is an introduction to R adapted from [8] with extra material from [9]. If you already have R experience, you might still want to browse this section in case you find something new. Prerequisites should be completed before proceeding. After that, the tutorial should take no longer than 50 minutes. 6.5.1 Style guide 6.5.2 Everything in R has a name 6.5.3 Everything in R is an object 6.5.4 Use functions to do things 6.5.5 R functions come in packages 6.5.6 R objects have class 6.5.7 R objects have structure 6.5.8 R only does what you tell it 6.5.9 Keyboard shortcuts 6.5.10 Whats next? 6.6 Graph basics 6.7 Data basics  top of page "],["display-design.html", "7 Designing effective displays 7.1 Stuff 7.2 More stuff", " 7 Designing effective displays 7.1 Stuff 7.2 More stuff  top of page "],["references.html", "8 References", " 8 References "]]
