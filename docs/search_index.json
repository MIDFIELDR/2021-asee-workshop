MIDFIELD contains student record data from 19882017 for approximately one million undergraduate, degree-seeking students at the partner institutions. The goal of this workshop is to make MIDFIELD more accessible to the ASEE community. The workshop introduces midfieldr (a package in the R software environment) that provides access to a MIDFIELD student-record data sample and tools to analyze and graph persistence metrics such as graduation rates. The workshop is designed for R beginners. By the end of the workshop, participants should be able to: Describe key variables in MIDFIELD data tables Select academic programs and populations to study Use midfieldr, an R package specifically designed for use with MIDFIELD Explore and tell a story from MIDFIELD data Explain key features of effective data displays Description The robustness of the MIDFIELD data allows us to emphasize an intersectional approach to the study of student records, permitting multiple categories of inequity such as race/ethnicity and sex to be considered simultaneously. To introduce beginners to R, participants work through a self-paced tutorial covering basic elements of the R computing language and environment. To introduce midfieldr and using it to work with student record data, participants work through a Get started tutorial in which they determine the numbers of students ever enrolled in two programs, group and summarize the data, and graph the results. For more experienced R users or anyone working at a faster pace, we offer a series of self-paced tutorials that introduce key features of midfieldr and how they are applied to compute persistence metrics and graph results. We also discuss the merits of the multiway graph design that is recommended for displaying results of this type. The agenda includes an interactive session to demonstrate contemporary principles of effective data display. Pre-workshop homework To get the most out of the workshop, you should have the essential software installed and running several days before the workshop to give you time to contact us with questions if anything goes amiss. Your homework is to install R and RStudio and the MIDFIELD R packages midfielddata and midfieldr. Instructions are given on the Install everything page.

Your pre-workshop homework: Install R and RStudio Install the remotes package Install midfielddata Install midfieldr Create a project Add some folders If you already have R and RStudio installed, this is a great time to Make sure your R installation is current Make sure your RStudio installation is current Update your packages by running: update.packages(ask = FALSE, checkBuilt = TRUE) Install R and RStudio The first steps are to install R and RStudio. Windows users may have to login as an Administrator before installing the software. Install R for your operating system Install RStudio, a user interface for R Once the installation is complete, you can take a 2-minute tour of the RStudio interface. Lets start (00:5702:32) by R Ladies Sydney (Richmond, 2018) The same video includes a longer (7 minute) tour of the four quadrants (panes) in RStudio if you are interested. The RStudio quadrants (07:2114:40) by R Ladies Sydney (Richmond, 2018) Install the remotes package The fundamental unit of shareable code in R is the package. For the R novice, an R package is like an app for Ra collection of functions, data, and documentation for doing work in R that is easily shared with others (Wickham, 2014). Most packages are obtained from the CRAN website (The Comprehensive R Archive Network, 2018-04-22). To install a CRAN package using RStudio: Launch RStudio The RStudio interface has several panes. We want the Files/Plots/Packages pane. Select the Packages tab Next, Click Install on the ribbon In the dialog box, type the name of the package. For our first package, type remotes to install the remotes package (Hester and others, 2021) Check the Install dependencies box Click the Install button In the RStudio Console, you should see a message like this one, package &#39;remotes&#39; successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked If successful, the package will appear in the Packages pane, e.g., Install midfielddata Install the midfielddata package first (Layton and others, 2021a). Because of its size, the data package is stored in a drat repository instead of CRAN. Installation takes time; please be patient and wait for the Console prompt &gt; to reappear. Type (or copy and paste) the following lines in the RStudio Console. # type in the RStudio Console install.packages(&quot;midfielddata&quot;, repos = &quot;https://MIDFIELDR.github.io/drat/&quot;, type = &quot;source&quot;) # be patient Once the Console prompt &gt; reappears, you can confirm a successful installation by viewing the package help page. In the Console, run: # type in the RStudio Console library(&quot;midfielddata&quot;) ? midfielddata If the installation is successful, the code chunk above should produce a view of the help page as shown here. If this step is successful, you can go on to the next step. Install midfieldr Earlier we installed the remotes package. To access its functions we use the library() function. # type in the RStudio Console library(&quot;remotes&quot;) Now we can use the install_github() function in the remotes package to install the midfieldr package from GitHub (Layton and others, 2021b). # type in the RStudio Console install_github(&quot;MIDFIELDR/midfieldr&quot;) You can confirm a successful installation by viewing the package help page. In the Console, run: # type in the RStudio Console library(&quot;midfieldr&quot;) ? midfieldr If the installation is successful, the code chunk above should produce a view of the help page as shown here. Create a project To begin any project, we create an RStudio Project file and directory. You can recognize an R project file by its .Rproj suffix. If you prefer your instructions with commentary, Start with a Project (02:3404:50) by R Ladies Sydney (Richmond, 2018) If you prefer basic written instructions, RStudio, File &gt; New Project &gt; New Directory &gt; New Project Or, click the New Project button in the Console ribbon, In the dialog box that appears, Type the workshop name as the directory name, for example, workshop, or if you like more detail, midfield-workshop-asee-2021 Use the browse button to select a location on your computer to create the project folder Click the Create Project button Whenever you work with the workshop materials, launch the workshop.Rproj file (using the name you actually used) to start the session. Add some folders While file organization is a matter of personal preference, we ask that you use the directory structure shown here for your work in the workshop. Assuming we called our project workshop, the minimal directory structure has three folders in it plus the .Rproj file at the top level.  workshop\\  data\\  results\\  scripts\\  workshop.Rproj  If you prefer your instructions with commentary, Make some folders (04:5006:08) by R Ladies Sydney (Richmond, 2018) If you prefer basic written instructions, use your usual method of creating new folders on your machine or you can use the New Folder button in the Files pane We use the folders as follows: data for data files figures for finished data displays scripts for R scripts that operate on data to produce results You finished your homework! References "],["about-r.html", "3 About R Features Data visualization References", " 3 About R Features R is an open source language and environment for statistical computing and graphics (R Core Team, 2021), ranked by IEEE in 2020 as the 6th most popular programming language (Python, Java, and C are the top three) (Cass, 2020). If you are new to R, some of its best features, paraphrasing Wickham (2014), are: R is free, open source, and available on every major platform, making it easy for others to replicate your work. More than 17,500 open-source R packages are available (Jun 2021). Many are cutting-edge tools. R packages provide deep-seated support for data analysis, e.g., missing values, data frames, and subsetting. RStudio, an integrated development environment (IDE) for R, includes a console, editor, and tools for plotting, history, debugging, and workspace management as well as access to GitHub for collaboration and version control (RStudio Team, 2016). Data visualization Charles Kostelnick (2007) writes, The array of design options in software like Microsoft Excel and PowerPoint creates the illusion of flexibility.  So marvelously malleable are these graphical effectsbut for whom and to what end? Paradoxically, then, even as the technology for visualizing data has become more sophisticated, it does not necessarily engender rhetorically sensitive design. The graphics tools in R provide the means to control every pixel in the service of rhetorically sensitive design. Designers can craft their visual arguments to balance logos, ethos, pathos, and kairos as appropriate for a given audience in a given rhetorical situation.
